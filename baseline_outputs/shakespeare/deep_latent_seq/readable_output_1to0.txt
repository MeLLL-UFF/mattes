A jumbled confession can only receive a jumbled absolution .	A halter gratis , a little means and sufferance .
I love rich Capulet's daughter .	I love thee ill than you do .
We're bound to each other in every possible way , except we need you to marry us .	Speak to yourself in every foul way , Which we may fear you to marry us .
I'll tell you more later about when and where we met , how we fell in love , and how we exchanged promises , but now I'm begging you : please , agree to marry us today .	Witness .
Holy Saint Francis , this is a drastic change !	Whate'er thou art , this is a glove of virtue !
Have you given up so quickly on Rosaline , whom you loved so much ?	Have you not cast away so strong , That you may remember me so much ?
Then young men love with their eyes , not with their hearts .	Then young men love their eyes , with their hearts ' hearts .
The groans you used to make are still ringing in my old ears .	The consequence sits in to make , All old tears in my purse .
There's still a stain on your cheek from an old tear that hasn't been washed off yet .	There's not a dream upon your lap , A hard eye doth draw thee thus near him .
If you were ever yourself , and this sadness was yours , you and your sadness were all for Rosaline .	If you were ever honest , and this gentleman was yours , And you were your joy for all this .
And now you've changed ?	And now thou hast thou been ?
Then repeat this after me : you can't expect women to be faithful when men are so unreliable .	Then end this : You shall not fail her , Nor be so fond when they are not sad .
You scolded me often for loving Rosaline .	You mar me truly for a good sinner .
I scolded you for obsessing about her , not for loving her , my student .	I am sorry for thee , for her not , for her loving my lord .
And you told me to bury my love .	And you that loves me to my bosom .
I didn't tell you to get rid of one love and replace her with another .	I pray you , tell me of this fiend And love her with another .
Please , I beg you , don't scold me .	Pray you , I beseech you , pardon me .
The other girl did not love me .	The other time I did not love me .
Oh , she knew very well that you were acting like you were in love without really knowing what love means .	O , she knew very well that you were not were in love or in such means May not love .
But come on , inconsistent young man , come with me .	But come on , young man , come with me , sir .
Let's get out of here .	Fortune , by the fiend .
I'm in a rush .	There's in a nunnery .
Go wisely and slowly .	Go and therefore stale .
Those who rush stumble and fall .	Those who laughs justly and justly power .
Where the devil can Romeo be ?	Where the devil can not be ?
Didn't he come home last night ?	Didst thou not meet him last night ?
Not to his father's house .	Not to his father's house .
I asked a servant .	I am a knave .
That fair-skinned , hard-hearted hussy , Rosaline is going to torment him until he goes insane .	That , sirrah , foul knave , is going to him till he goes gone .
Tybalt , old Capulet's nephew , has sent a letter to Romeo's father's house .	News , old Egeon , Since 'tis a house , To give a message fly .
I bet it's a challenge .	I warrant a challenge .
Romeo will answer the challenge .	Yearly will I answer the challenge .
Any man who knows how to write can answer a letter .	Tis man That knows how to write a husband can not hear .
No , Romeo will respond to the letter's writer , telling him whether he accepts the challenge .	No , will hie thee to the Sagittary the challenge , Yet he knows not the challenge .
Oh , poor Romeo !	O poor thousand !
Is he man enough at this point to face off with Tybalt ?	Is he not enough to watch this off With false apparel off ?
Why , what's Tybalt's story ?	Why , what's he indeed ?
He knows what ?	He knows not ?
He looks skinny , like a dried herring without its eggs , and he hasn't got his girl .	He looks not , like a drinking crust In his master's nurse and he hath got his girl .
O flesh , flesh , you've turned pale and weak like a fish .	O flesh , flesh , and thou hast turned ten times a stranger .
Now he's ready for	Now sits I for this !
Good morning to you both .	Good morrow to you both .
What do you mean I faked you out ?	What do you mean I am not led ?
You gave us the slip , sir , the slip .	You gave the chain , sir , the ides of March .
Can't you understand what I'm saying ?	Dost thou understand what thou art saying ?
The Right .	The matter .
My employer is as good as yours .	My resolution's is as good as yours .
But he's not better than mine .	But 'tis not better than mine .
Well then .	Well then .
You lie .	You lie .
Gregory , remember how to slash .	Trinculo , remember how to th ' affairs .
What ?	What ?
Come break this up , Benvolio .	Come this part , by this .
I'm losing this duel of wits .	Thou hast this warlike isle of Egypt .
Keep going , keep going , or I'll declare myself the winner .	Keep thou , keep going , or I'll drown myself the date .
You have more wild goose in one of your jokes than I have in five of mine .	You have more wild years in one of your daughters than I have in one of mine .
Was I even close to you in the chase for the goose ?	Was I not known to you in the commonwealth for the goose ?
You were never with me for anything if you weren't there for the goose .	You were never with me for thus if you were there for the goose .
I'll bite you on the ear for that joke .	I'll not assure thee for the fashion that follows .
No , good goose , don't bite me .	No , good Fleance , not dare not abuse .
Your joke is a very bitter apple .	Your grace is a very sensible .
Your humor is a spicy sauce .	Your humor is a sailmaker .
Then isn't it just the right dish for a sweet goose ?	Then is it not the right for sweet , a most palpable fool ?
Oh , that's a joke made out of leather that spreads itself thin , from the width of an inch to as fat as a yard .	O , that's a touch , Which thou shalt find out of thy shoulder to the Dane , As opposite as an orange , to a whore .
I stretch my joke for that word "fat." If you add that word to the word "goose , " it shows that you are a fat goose .	I am sorry for my word that thou dost ask for me that word to the word , that it shows you that a goodly are unnatural .
Why , isn't all this joking better than groaning about love ?	Why , all this aim but well unto love of love ?
Now you're sociable .	Now be thou jocund .
Now you're Romeo .	Now be thou jocund .
Oh , you're wrong .	O , thou speak'st .
I would have made it short .	I would have made it short .
I had come to the deepest part of my tale , and I planned to say nothing more on the topic .	I had come to the part of my story , and I shall say nothing more to see the firmament on the topic .
Here's something good .	Here's something good .
There's two , a man and a woman .	There's two , a man and a woman .
Peter !	Saint Valentine , I am not lost , But so , and by the manner of it is a gentlewoman , That I did not , to be so much a man .
I'm at your service .	Be at your service .
Give me my fan , Peter .	Give me my robe , Saint Jeronimy .
Good morning , gentlemen .	Good morrow , masters .
Good afternoon , fair lady .	Good morrow , fair lady .
Is it now afternoon ?	Is it possible ?
It's not earlier than that , I tell you .	Tis not so fond , I tell thee .
The Get out of here !	The breaking of Cassio !
What kind of man are you ?	What kind of man is these ?
I'm a man , my lady , that God has made for himself to ruin .	Thou art a man , my lady , that hath made for himself to ruin .
I swear , you speak the truth .	I prithee , speak you the truth .
For himself to ruin , " he says .	For himself to ruin , he says he .
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I can find young Romeo ?	Sirrah , wilt thou hold of me , where I can not choose ?
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you find him than he was when you started looking for him .	I can not tell , but young night will be victorious when you find him when he was when you led him for his wife .
I am the youngest man by that name , because there is no one younger , or worse .	I am the fairest man by that name , And there is no one or two , nor any .
You speak well .	You speak well .
Is the worst well ?	Is the worst well ?
Very well taken , I believe , very wise .	Very well , I believe , very well .
She will A pimp !	She will a Christian !
I've found it out .	Thou found it out .
What have you found out ?	What have you found out ?
Romeo , are you going to your father's for lunch ?	Home , is 't not to your father's house ?
Let's go there .	Trouble us no further .
I'll follow after you .	I'll follow you after .
He says more in one minute than he does in a whole month .	He says more in one more than he does in a whole show .
If he says anything against me , I'll humble him , even if he were stronger than he is , and twenty punks like him .	If he say above me , I'll thank him , though he were more than he is , and twenty such looks he .
If I can't do it myself , I'll find someone who can .	If I will do it myself , I'll find thee what she can .
That dirty rat !	That delicate forbid !
I'm not one of his sluts .	Be not one of his infirmity .
I'm not one of his punk friends who carries a knife .	Thou art not one of his friends than a tooth .
I didn't see anybody use you for kicks .	I shall see thee hanged for thy own burden .
If I had seen something like that , I would have quickly pulled out my weapon .	If I had seen nothing like that , I would quickly have bought my beard .
Believe me , I'll draw my sword as quick as any other man if I see a fight starting and the law is on my side .	Believe me , I'll draw my sword as any one as any cause If I see a fight and the law is on my side .
Now , I swear , I'm so angry that I'm shaking all over .	Now , I prithee , speak so that thou art The guilty of charity .
That rotten scoundrel !	That his ambition !
Nurse , give my regards to to your lady .	Sirrah , give my regards to your lady .
I swear to you , You have a good heart , and believe me , I'll tell her that .	I prithee , you have a good heart , and , good She , let me tell her that .
Lord , Lord , she'll be a happy woman .	Lord , Lord , she'll be a happy woman .
What are you going to tell her , Nurse ?	What sayst thou to her , tell her I ?
You're not paying attention to me .	One but not "Amen , Edmund .
At Friar Lawrence's cell she can make confession and be married .	At Signor mud she can make amends and be angry .
Wait good Nurse .	Tarry so good .
Within an hour , one of my men will come to you behind the abbey wall and give you a rope ladder .	Within an hour of one , my spirits will come to greet you in the mart And give you a rope .
Goodbye .	Adieu .
Be honest and helpful , and I'll repay you for your efforts .	Be honest and good , and I'll salute you for your Grace .
Goodbye .	Adieu .
Sing my praises to your mistress .	I'll commend my mistress to your mistress .
May God in heaven bless you .	May heaven in heaven bless thee .
Now please listen , sir .	Now fare you well , sir .
What do you have to say , my dear Nurse ?	What do you have , my lord , to my flight ?
Can your man keep a secret ?	Can not your wife be a secret ?
Haven't you ever heard the saying , "Two can conspire to put one away" ?	Dost thou think so , The goodness can not seal to one In one ?
I assure you , my man is as true as steel .	I assure you , my man is as true as steel .
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .	Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady .
Lord , Lord , when she was a little baby , Oh , there is one nobleman in the city , a guy named Paris , who would be happy to claim her as his own .	Lord , Lord , when she was a little prey , Why , there is one drop in the city , a creature , who were so happy to claim her own his own .
I make her angry sometimes by saying that Paris is more handsome than you are .	I make her angry didst hear her say that is more sufficient than you are .
But when I say so , I swear she turns white as a sheet .	But when I say so , I swear she is as clear as a dream .
Don't " Yes , Nurse , what about that ?	Do not , madam , what of that ?
They both begin with the letter "R." Ah , you jokester , that's the dog's name .	They both begin with the letter Wherein I run , And you , the sixth of July .
Give my compliments to your lady .	Give my dread lady to your grace .
Yes , a thousand times .	Ay , a thousand times .
Peter !	Saint Valentine , I am not lost , But so , and by the manner of it is a gentlewoman , That I did not , to be so much a man .
I'm ready .	Thou livest .
I sent the Nurse at nine o'clock .	I am sent the fairy i ' th ' morning .
Maybe she can't find him .	Perchance she will not find him .
That can't be .	That will not be .
Oh , she's slow !	O hated potion , hence !
Love's messengers should be thoughts , which fly ten times faster than sunbeams .	Old they should be , which fly more sorrow than ten times faster .
That's three hours since nine o'clock , but she hasn't come back .	That's three days ere well live , And she hath come back .
If she was young and passionate , she'd move as fast as a ball .	If she was young , and thereto have sworn As fast as a conjurer , And .
My words would bounce her to my sweet love , and his words would bounce her back to me .	My words would not to her sweet , And his sweet words would freeze her back And bear me thus .
But a lot of old people act like they're already dead , sluggish , slow , fat , and colorless , like lead .	But a good thing old people have looked like they are gone , Outlive , sound , and affable , like lead , and firm .
Oh sweet Nurse , what news do you bring ?	O sweet counsel , what news do you bring ?
Have you spoken to him ?	Have you not spoken to him ?
Send your man away .	Send your man away .
Peter , wait for me at the gate .	Villain , thou dost hear for 's .
Now , good sweet Nurse , Oh Lord , why do you look so sad ?	Now , good sweet sweet , O Lord Stanley , think you so sad ?
Even if the news is sad , tell me with a smile on your face .	Even if the news be sad , tell me a part of your own face .
If the news is good , you're ruining the sweet news by playing a trick with a sour face like that .	If the good news be , thou canst rail by the tardy side with a pearl With every little dream .
I am tired .	I am undone .
Leave me alone for a minute .	Leave me alone for a nunnery .
Oh my , my bones ache so much .	O my bones , my bones look so much .
I wish you had my bones , and I had your news .	I wish you had my bones , and I had your news .
Can't you wait for a moment ?	Dost thou stayed for a nunnery ?
Don't you see that I'm out of breath ?	Do not you see that I'm out of breath ?
How can you be out of breath when you have enough breath to tell me that you're out of breath ?	How can you be out of breath when you have none in love that thou hast shifted out of breath ?
The excuse you make to delay the news is longer than the news itself .	The merchandise you shall make the news come more than the news that is done .
Is the news good or bad ?	Is the news good or bad ?
Answer that question .	Answer that question .
Tell me if it's good or bad , and I'll wait for the details .	Tell me if 'tis good , and for the tales are no leading of the gold .
Tell me so I can be satisfied .	Tell me so I can be satisfied .
Is it good or bad ?	Is it good or bad ?
Well , you have made a foolish choice .	Well , you have made a foolish name .
You don't know how to pick a man .	You know not how to be a Roman .
Romeo ?	Whither ?
No , not him , though his face is more handsome than any man's , and his legs are prettier , and as for his hands and feet and body , they're not much to speak of , and yet they're beyond compare .	No , not , though his face is more proper than his , and any legs , and his fears are as huge and his hands , And yet , for he , and yet are not fair , Of those of hunger .
He's not the most polite man in the world , but , believe me , he's gentle as a lamb .	Thou art the most ridiculous gentleman in the world , but , believe me , an gentle as a fox .
Well , do what you want .	Well , do you fear .
Be good .	Be good .
Have you had lunch yet ?	Have you had yet yet ?
No , I haven't had lunch .	No , I have had none .
Everything you told me I already knew .	Pronounce you with money I told you nothing .
What does he say about our marriage ?	What says he is our grace of marriage ?
What about that ?	What manner of law ?
My head is pounding .	My head is lock'd .
My back aches too ,	My affections too , too !
Believe me , I'm sorry you're in pain .	Believe me , thou hast changed in thy pain .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what did my love Romeo say ?	Sweet , sweet sweet , sweet , what , for my love do not say ?
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , who is courteous , kind , handsome , and , I believe , virtuous , where is your mother ?	Thy love , says , like an honorable gentleman , That is a kind , amazed , O , and I , O , where is thy mother ?
Where is my mother ?	Where is my mother ?
Why , she's inside .	Why , she's gone .
Where else would she be ?	Where else would she be ?
Your answer is so strange !	Your answer is so strange !
Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?	Your love says , like an honorable gentleman , is your mother ?
Are you this impatient ?	Are you this "gamut" ?
Come on , you're being ridiculous !	Come , thou art a mocker !
Is this the cure for my aching bones ?	Is this the cure for my humor of fortune ?
From now on , take care of your messages yourself .	From now on , take heed of thy bones .
You're making such a fuss .	Belike 'tis like a nature .
Come on , what did Romeo say ?	Come , what did he say ?
Do you have permission to go out and take confession today ?	Do you have friends to go out and take 'em today ?
I do .	I do .
Then hurry up and rush over to Friar Lawrence's cell .	Then stand you up and hasten The generals to woo .
There's a husband there who's waiting to make you his wife .	There's a husband i ' th ' forest , alive and his wife .
Now I see the blood rushing to your cheeks .	Now I see the blood o ' th ' air .
You blush bright red as soon as you hear any news .	You live bright as well as you hear , any news .
Go to the church .	Go to the church .
Your love will use it to climb up to your window while it's dark .	Your love will use it to thee , For God's death shall be bitter into .
Go .	Go .
I'll go to lunch .	I'll go to thee .
You go to Friar Lawrence's cell .	You go to fetch my bosom .
I'm only trying to keep the peace .	Thou hast not been the peace of thy sword .
Either put away your sword or use it to help me stop this fight .	Either put me hence for thy sword , To give it thee thus near my sight .
What ?	What ?
I hate the word peace like I hate hell , all Montagues , and you .	I hate the word hence I hate , Which all the world o'erwhelm thee , and all the world .
Let's go at it , coward !	Fortune , i ' th ' moon , ho !
Use your clubs and spears !	Use thy plainness and thy scars !
Hit them !	Part them !
Beat them down !	Beat them !
Down with the Capulets !	Down with the topmast !
Down with the Montagues !	Down with the topmast !
What's this noise ?	Wherefore is this ?
I want my sword .	I am my sword .
Old Montague is here , and he's waving his sword around just to make me mad .	Old of Macbeth , And here his bluest sword Doth not send me mad to make me mad .
Capulet , you villain !	Avaunt , thou villain !
You're not taking one step toward an enemy .	One carrion death , Like high-reared bulwarks .
Wish me luck .	Twas you to Tubal .
Thank you , dear Nurse .	Fare thee well , nymph .
Amen , amen .	Amen , amen .
But whatever misfortunes occur , they can't ruin the joy I feel with one look at her .	But lest that suffice , they must not wish the joy I am one of her for her .
Therefore , love each other in moderation .	Therefore , love each other in his bounty .
That is the key to long-lasting love .	That is the key o ' love .
Too fast is as bad as too slow .	Too fast is as bad as too black .
Here comes the lady .	Here comes the lady .
Oh , a footstep as light as hers will never endure the rocky road of life .	Oh , a cherubim Thou wast as free as she will never endure the bidding of life .
That's how flimsy and unreal pleasure is .	Farewell , how affable and vile .
Romeo will thank you , my girl , for both of us .	Yearly will I thank you , my lord , for both of us .
I'll give him equal thanks , so we're even .	I'll give him thanks , so they are not .
Ah , Juliet if you're as happy as I am , and you're better with words , tell me about the happiness you imagine we'll have in our marriage .	Ah , if thou be as honest as I am , and thou art with me , being near the truth of war you have in our father's marriage .
I can imagine more than I can say , I have more on my mind than words .	I can not deserve more than I , I have more than my mind on my words .
Come , come with me , and we'll do the job quickly .	Come , come with me , and the same We shall give thee .
I'm begging you , good Mercutio , let's call it a day .	Be assured you , good Meg , call it a day .
You're like one of those guys who walks into a bar , slams his sword on the table , and then says , "I pray I never have to use you." By the time he orders his second drink , he pulls his sword on the bartender for no reason at all .	Belike but one of those who are married , Or on his peril , the sword of his side , and then , yet I never shall have to use to read the time , he took his present hand , his dukedom on the pardon any more than all for no reason .
Am I really like one of those guys ?	Am I not one of those unhappy wars ?
Come on , you can be as angry as any guy in Italy when you're in the mood .	Come , you can not be as angry as any fellow in Italy when you're in the mood .
And what about that ?	And what of that ?
If there were two men like you , pretty soon there'd be none because the two of you would kill each other .	If there were two men desire." Why , by it shall be two of the English And would you hear some other .
You would fight with a man if he had one more whisker or one less whisker in his beard than you have in your beard .	You would fight with a man if he had more one or one himself confessed his other Than in his beard in a beard .
You'll fight with a man who's cracking nuts just because you have hazelnut-colored eyes .	You'll fight with a man That thou art ware of yet but themselves .
Only you would look for a fight like that .	Twas you would look for a fight like that .
Your head is as full of fights as an egg is full of yolk , but your head has been beaten like scrambled eggs from so much fighting .	Your head is as full of valor as an hour of thine , but your head hath been his beard from beating looks so much That natural Roman ever .
You started a fight with a man who coughed in the street because he woke up a dog that was sleeping in the sun .	You cut a handkerchief with a man That in the midst that he runs down a while That he was hid in the vapor of the sun .
Didn't you argue it out with your tailor for wearing one of his new suits before the right season ?	Wilt thou prate with me too , within the world of his new aspect To read the full of new fates ?
And with another for tying the new shoes he made with old laces ?	And with another subject To the senate house with an weak eye ?
And yet you're the one who wants to teach me about restraint !	And yet the one be given to me That would devise to speak !
If I were in the habit of fighting the way you are , my life insurance rates would be sky high .	If I were in the habit of the spirit you are , my lord , you would be constant things were high .
Your life insurance ?	Your life ?
That's foolish .	That's good .
Oh great , here come the Capulets .	O great lord , here come the key .
Well , well , I don't care .	Well , well , I pray you .
Put it together with something else .	Set it along with something else .
Make it a word and a blow .	Make it a word and a blow .
You'll find me ready enough to do that , sir , if you give me a reason .	You'll find me enough to do 't , sir , if you give me a reason .
Can't you find a reason without my giving you one ?	Dost thou not find a reason without my brother's one ?
Mercutio , you hang out with Romeo .	Faith , you hang out with torches .
Hang out ? " Who do you think we are , musicians in a band ?	Hang out , Who ?
If we look like musicians to you , you can expect to hear nothing but noise .	If we look like to you , you shall entreat , To hear nothing but hear nothing .
We're talking here in a public place .	Speak not here in a place .
Either go someplace private , or talk it over rationally , or else just go away .	Either go thy present hand , Or break it off or else , Or else thy friends will go .
Out here everybody can see us .	Out o ' th ' storm .
Men's eyes were made to see things , so let them watch .	Twere eyes were made to see , so let them see .
I won't move to please anybody .	I will content thee to fear .
Well , may peace be with you .	Well , may peace be with you .
Here comes my man , the man I'm looking for .	Here comes my man , the man is notwithstanding for .
He's not your man .	He's not your man .
Tybalt , I have a reason to love you that lets me put aside the rage I should feel and excuse that insult .	Furthermore , I have a reason to love you that , For me shall never enter the ear And feel that little .
I am no villain .	I am no villain .
So , goodbye .	So , adieu .
I can tell that you don't know who I am .	I can not tell you that I am not .
Boy , your words can't excuse the harm you've done to me .	Boy , your words will draw the harm to thee now .
So now turn and draw your sword .	So now and turn thy sword .
And so , good Capulet , which is a name I love like my own name , you should be satisfied with what I say .	And so , good yeoman , Whose name is I love , I am not lost , if you should be satisfied with what I say .
This calm submission is dishonorable and vile .	This disturbed consequence Is twice and vile .
What do you want from me ?	What do you with me ?
Will you pull your sword out of its sheath ?	Will you withdraw me into thy sword of "ifs" ?
Hurry up , or I'll smack you on the ears with my sword before you have yours drawn .	Approach , or I'll lay 't with my sword And put my sword on this while I have drawn .
I'll fight you .	I'll fight thee .
Noble Mercutio , put your sword away .	Noble , put your sword on your hand .
Let's get away , Tybalt .	Let's fetch them , away .
I've been hurt .	Thou hast railed on thyself .
May a plague curse both your families .	May a plague dashed your spirits .
I'm finished .	Thou speak'st aright .
Did he get away clean ?	Did he not go away ?
What , are you hurt ?	What , are you hurt ?
But it's enough .	But 'tis enough .
Where is my page ?	Where is my office ?
Have courage , man .	Have done , man .
The wound can't be that bad .	The labor will not be that kind .
No , it's not as deep as a well , or as wide as a church door , but it's enough .	No , as 'tis as a fee , as well as a maid , For the dead sings as well , but .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .	For for me tomorrow , and you'll find me in a grave .
I'm done for in this world , I believe .	Be done in this world , I believe thee .
May a plague strike both your houses .	May a plague off the Turks .
I can't believe that dog , that rat , that mouse , that cat could scratch me to death !	I will not believe that dog , dog , that suffer'st , That could not give me death to death !
That braggart , punk villain who fights like he learned swordsmanship from a manual !	That , alas , villain , That he is mad To hear a lewd interpreter !
Why the hell did you come in between us ?	Why the hell did you come in us ?
He struck me from under your arm .	He struck me from thy arm .
I thought it was the right thing to do .	I thought it was the right thing to do .
Take me inside some house , Benvolio , or I'll pass out .	Take me some taper , or , or none , or none .
May a plague strike both your families !	May a plague off the Turks !
They've turned me into food for worms .	Twas to bear This food upon you .
I'm done for .	There's done for .
Curse your families !	Rumble thy bellyful !
Oh Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !	Oh , defend , O brave mole is dead !
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .	Here comes the ancient wrestler back again .
He's alive and victorious , and Mercutio's dead ?	He's dead and self-covered , and thou diest ?
Either you , or I , or both of us have to go with him .	Either you , or I , or both of us have go to fetch him .
Wretched boy , you hung out with him here , and you're going to go to heaven with him .	Peace , ho , you have kept him here , And thou art to heaven , with him .
This fight will decide who dies .	This fight will they carry him sound .
Romeo , get out of here .	Ho , get thee out of here .
The citizens are around , and Tybalt is dead .	The citizens are riotous , and therefore is dead .
Don't stand there shocked .	Therefore stand there .
The Prince will give you the death penalty if you get caught .	The Prince will give you the death if you give thee bail .
So get out of here !	So get out of here !
Why are you waiting ?	Why dost thou spit ?
The man who killed Mercutio , which way did he go ?	The man who killed not , Which did he go ?
Tybalt , that murderer , which way did he run ?	Yea , that which , Which did he run unto ?
Tybalt is lying over there .	Twill look upon this hour .
Speak , nephew .	Speak , gentle heavens .
Were you here when it started ?	Were you here when it came ?
Where are the evil men who started this fight ?	Where are the god That thou wilt hear this fight ?
Oh , noble prince , I can tell you everything about the unfortunate circumstances of this deadly fight .	O noble prince , I can not tell thee : The course of warlike purpose , this deadly love .
He killed your relative , brave Mercutio , and then young Romeo killed him .	He killed your brave knave , brave and then , young Kate killed him .
Tybalt was my nephew !	Wrong was my turquoise !
He was my brother's son !	He was my brother's son !
Oh cousin , cousin !	O cousin , cousin !
Benvolio , who started this fight ?	Peace. , Who comes with this heavenly battle ?
Romeo cried out , "Stop , my friends .	Best cried out , "Tarry , my friends .
Break it up." Then he jumped in between them and forced them to put their swords down .	Weigh it not : "But yet" in negligence And bring them to their senses With devils on their swords .
Before I could break up the fight , Tybalt was killed .	Before I could break the peace , break off the word .
Romeo ran away when Tybalt fell dead .	Stand far away when thou liest .
Benvolio is part of the Montague family .	Best is part of the selfsame tenor .
He's not telling the truth .	Thou canst not hear the truth .
There were twenty Montagues fighting in this awful riot , and together those twenty could only kill one man .	There were twenty years rails upon this hill , And many men could not read with one man .
You , Prince , are the man who can give me justice .	You , Prince , are the man who can give me justice .
Romeo killed Tybalt .	Hearty killed .
Romeo must die .	Far must die .
Romeo killed Tybalt .	Hearty killed .
Who should now pay the price for Mercutio's life ?	Who should now pay the price for aught of life ?
His crime did justice's job by taking Tybalt's life .	His sickness did bear me by thy humor , sir .
I'm involved in your rivalry .	Be comforted in thy snores .
I'll punish you so harshly that you'll regret causing me this loss .	I'll not assure thee so above that you'll be ashamed of this foul business .
I won't listen to your pleas or excuses .	I will content your ladyship but to Master .
You can't get out of trouble by praying or crying , so don't bother .	You will not get out of trouble or nobly , Nor by so thou didst not .
Take away this body , and do what I say .	Take away this body , and do what I say .
Showing mercy by pardoning killers only causes more murders .	Far mercy by these sorrows doth not wish more .
Or else love is blind , and its best time is the night .	Or else is sick , and his is ta'en up the night .
I wish night would come , like a widow dressed in black , so I can learn how to submit to my husband and lose my virginity .	I dare look like , sir , a coward angel in my anger , so I can not learn how to my husband and my education .
Let the blood rushing to my cheeks be calmed .	Let the blood be spotted to my age .
Come , night .	Come , night .
Come , Romeo .	Come , prepare .
You're whiter than snow on the black wings of a raven .	One minded like snow ; the fair snow of a deceitful .
His face will make the heavens so beautiful that the world will fall in love with the night and forget about the garish sun .	His face will make the heavens so gross As all the world in love will fall in the seen and devise the sun .
Is that the rope ladder Romeo told you to pick up ?	Is that the leaf turned the flock of thee to seek ?
Yes , yes , this is the rope ladder .	Ay , lady , this is the soldier's blow .
Oh my , what's the news ?	O my lord , what's the news ?
Why do you look so upset ?	Why do you look so pale ?
He's dead .	He's dead .
We're ruined , lady , we're ruined !	Foul , marry , lady , thou hast ruined our heads !
What an awful day !	What an hour now !
Can God be so jealous and hateful ?	Can 't be so jealous and maidhood ?
Romeo is hateful , even though God isn't .	Far is cunning , But yet can be thee .
What kind of devil are you to torture me like this ?	What kind of night Wherein thou hast slain me thus ?
This is as bad as the tortures of hell .	This is as blessed as the likes of hell .
Has Romeo killed himself ?	Hast thou slain me ?
Just say "Yes" and I will turn more poisonous than the snake with the evil eye .	Nor say I will not break the blood And ever graced the blood with an empty eye .
If he's been killed , say "Yes." If not , say "No." These short words will determine my joy or my pain .	If thou hast killed , say , not say , But heaven looks modest words for my bones and service Upon my worthless .
I'll send my eyes to prison , and they'll never be free to look at anything again .	I'll send my eyes to prison , and never shall be free at feet To see thee happy .
I'll give my vile body back to the earth .	I'll give my body gentle hither to the earth .
Oh , Tybalt , Tybalt , he was the best friend I had .	O , cleave , he , the best I was the best daughter .
I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die .	I wish I had not lived long enough to see him die .
Has Romeo been killed , and is Tybalt dead too ?	Hast thou slain , and is killed dead too ?
Tybalt was my dearest cousin .	Temperance was my dearest cousin .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished .	Budge is dead , and calls and been banished .
Oh God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?	O God , did not hand unto her blood ?
It did , it did .	It did , it did not .
Curse the day this happened , but it did .	Know the day this is but it did .
Oh , he's like a snake disguised as a flower .	Oh , 'twas a toy in a ale .
Did a dragon ever hide in such a beautiful cave ?	Did a Dian ever hide in such a fair degree ?
He's a raven with the feathers of the dove .	Thou art a boil of the watery moon .
Oh nature , what were you doing in hell ?	O nature , what were you in here in hell ?
Was there ever such an evil book with such a beautiful cover ?	Was there ever such an evil woman with such a fair accusation ?
Ah , where's my servant ? , Give me some brandy. , These griefs , these pains , these sorrows make me old .	Ah , where's my fool ? , Give me some taper , these competitors , You , these evil , make me old .
Shame on Romeo !	Shame on thee !
I hope sores cover your tongue for a wish like that !	I hope thy authority had for thy thought , A hog !
He was not born to be shameful .	He was not born to be undone .
He deserves only honor , complete honor .	He had not honor , honor .
Oh , I was such a beast to be angry at him .	Oh , I was such a bird to be angry at him .
Are you going to say good things about the man who killed your cousin ?	Are you not good ?
But why , you villain , did you kill my cousin ?	But wherefore , you villain , did you kill my cousin ?
Probably because my cousin the villain would have killed my husband .	Pluck my cousin the villain would have killed my husband .
All this is comforting news .	All this is harsh enough .
Why , then , should I cry ?	Why , then , should I cry ?
I would be glad to forget about it , but it weighs on my memory like sins linger in guilty minds .	I would be glad to see it , but it is upon my sins upon my nails With hostile arms in presence .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo has been banished."	Grim dead , and most puissant death hath been dishonored , That I have been felt .
That banishment is worse than the murder of ten thousand Tybalts .	That foul skin is worse than the devil of ten thousand ducats .
Tybalt's death would be bad enough if that was all .	Despise me If ever be well known that all was done .
It would have been better if , after she said , "Tybalt's dead , " she told me my mother or my father , or both , were gone .	It would have been better , if she said , falsely , she said , how she loves me or my mother , or both , were gone .
But to say that Tybalt's dead and then say , "Romeo has been banished." To say that is like saying that my father , my mother , Tybalt , Romeo , and Juliet have all been killed , they're all dead .	But to say that is dead and then , Horatio , hath not say that is , I say that is like my father , my father , and , ay , hath been all , oh , all they're dead .
Romeo has been banished." That news brings infinite death .	Gallants , Thou know'st That e'er my servants did fall .
No words can express the pain .	No words can not make the pain .
Where are my father and my mother , Nurse ?	Where are my father and my mother , coz ?
They are crying and moaning over Tybalt's corpse .	They are tied and importuned men are stol'n upon the streets .
Are you going to join them ?	Are you not going to hasten them ?
I'll bring you there .	I'll bring you there .
Are they washing out his wounds with their tears ?	Are they his eyes with his wounds ?
I'll cry my tears for Romeo's banishment when their tears are dry .	I'll cry my tears for success And die their daggers are at their hands .
Pick up this rope ladder .	Stand up this gentleman .
He made this rope ladder to be a highway to my bed , but I am a virgin , and I will die a virgin and a widow .	He made this juice to a paltry seal to my bed , but I am a virgin , and I will die and a slave and a widow .
And death , not Romeo , can take my virginity !	And death , not , wilt thou take my coxcomb !
Go to your bedroom .	Go to thy house .
I'll find Romeo to comfort you .	I'll find thee shall comfort you .
I know where he is .	I know where he is .
Listen , your Romeo will be here tonight .	Hark , your imprisonment will be here tonight .
I'll go to him .	I'll go to him .
He's hiding out in Friar Lawrence's cell .	Thou liest within me , In Egypt familiar .
Romeo , come out .	Masters , come away .
Come out , you frightened man .	Come , you deceive me .
Father , what's the news ?	What , is the news ?
You know too much about suffering .	You know too much about your Highness .
I have news for you about the Prince's punishment .	I have news for you of the selfsame tenor .
Is the Prince's punishment any less awful than doomsday ?	Is the mighty majesty of this far words ?
Ha , banishment ?	Ha , where's her ?
Be merciful and say "death." Exile is much worse than death .	Be far within me and say nothing is worse than death .
Don't say "banishment." From now on , you are banished from Verona .	Therefore heaven lies upon 's , now , being banished , by thy words .
You should be able to endure this because the world is broad and wide .	You should be able to endure this And the world is firm and sententious .
There is no world for me outside the walls of Verona , except purgatory , torture , and hell itself .	There is no world for me in the kitchen wench , between the Capitol , " and sighing itself .
So to be banished from Verona is like being banished from the world , and being banished from the world is death .	So to be banished from honesty of being banished , and the being delicate , To blame is the most expensive death .
Calling death banishment is like cutting off my head with a golden ax and smiling while I'm being murdered .	Grim death !
Oh , deadly sin !	O heavy sin !
Oh , rude and unthankful boy !	Oh , ay and honest and ill !
It's torture , not mercy .	Tis hour , not yet .
Flies are healthier and more honorable and better suited for romance than Romeo .	Wisdom and irrevocable is more honorable than better than for parrots of exceeding honesty .
Flies can kiss her , but I must flee the city .	Better can not kiss her , but I must needs the Turk .
Flies are like free men , but I have been banished .	Pluck such men but all , but I have been banished .
And yet you say that exile is not death ?	And yet you say that is not honesty That ever ?
Did you have no poison , no sharp knife , no weapon you could use to kill me quickly , nothing so disgraceful , except banishment ?	Did you not have no poison , no longer , that no instrument could I use to kill thee , She dead , nor clipped , but so ?
Oh Friar , damned souls use the word banishment to describe hell .	O wicked cousin , King shame To the word disguised against me .
They howl about banishment .	They calls upon 's .
If you're a member of a divine spiritual order of men who forgive sins , and you say you're my friend , how do you have the heart to mangle me with the word banishment ?	If thou art a divine of a thief of men That may change thee , and say thou art my friend , how do you have the heart to buy me with the word ?
You foolish madman , listen to me for a moment .	You foolish poison , sir , to be a jot .
Your servants were fighting your enemy's servants before I got here .	Your servants were mortal in your land I hear here .
I drew my sword to part them .	I ' faith , my liege .
As we were trading blows , more and more people showed up to join the fight , until the Prince came and broke everyone up .	As we were basilisks , This more amazement Shall I hold thee up , And the Prince , till she went into the throne and warm thee .
Oh , where's Romeo ?	O gull , where's the Sexton ?
Have you seen him today ?	Have you not seen him today ?
I'm glad he wasn't here for this fight .	Thus he is not here for this fight .
I headed toward him , but he saw me coming and hid in the woods .	I sued toward him , but he did me woo and devise the word .
He's been seen there many mornings , crying tears that add drops to the morning dew and making a cloudy day cloudier with his sighs .	Thou shalt see anything many kings , puffed up that servants , and the bagpipe carries one of his tribe Are here with his addition .
But as soon as the sun rises in the east , my sad son comes home to escape the light .	But as soon as the sun rises in the watery , my sad friend Katherina comes to the light of the fire .
Oh , you're just going to talk about banishment again .	O , thou art not to thyself , yet again I am .
Don't say anything else .	Therefore he do nothing .
Oh , so madmen like you are also deaf .	Oh , so oft Are you so well .
How should madmen hear , if wise men can't even see ?	How should we hear , if wise men must not see ?
Let me talk to you about your situation .	Let me talk to you of your distrust .
You can't talk about something that you don't feel .	You shall not talk so well That you do not .
If you were as young as I am , if you were in love with Juliet , if you had just married her an hour ago , if then you murdered Tybalt , if you were lovesick like me , and if you were banished , then you might talk about it .	If you were as young as I am , if you were in love with you , if you had not married an hour ( if you could not be married , if you were graveled for me , if you were , then , you then might you talk about it .
Get up .	Get thee hence .
Somebody's knocking .	Roundly replied .
Hide yourself , good Romeo .	Use lenity , good Monsieur Melancholy .
I won't hide unless all the mist from my heartsick groans envelopes me like fog and conceals me from people's searching eyes .	I will hide all the dangers With my son's hairs Tell me that thou art from me and from thy fortunes understand .
Why are you knocking so hard ?	Why dost thou sound so hard ?
Where do you come from ?	Where do you come from ?
What do you want ?	What do you ?
Oh , holy Friar , Oh , tell me , holy Friar , where is my lady's husband ?	O wicked Richard , oh , tell me , how , oh , where my husband's husband is my husband ?
Where's Romeo ?	Where's satisfaction ?
Oh , he's acting just like Juliet , just like her .	O , therefore , send me mad , Nor like her art .
Oh painful sympathy !	Oh thou pernicious caitiff !
She's lying on the ground just like him , blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .	Bear him naked and the day Is twice , and weeping , weeping and weeping .
Stand up if you're really a man .	Stand , if thou art a man .
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand up .	For sake , for her sake , rise up and stand up .
Why should you fall into so deep a moan ?	Why should you fall so into a thought ?
Nurse !	Holla !
Ah sir , ah sir .	Ah sir , sir .
Well , death is the end for everybody .	Well , death is the end for the maids .
Were you talking about Juliet ?	Were you not so ?
How is she ?	How is she ?
Where is she ?	Where is she ?
How is she doing ?	How is she she ?
What does my hidden wife say about our ruined love ?	What does my wife say about our noble grace ?
She's calling out my name as if I were a bullet murdering her , just like I murdered her relative .	Bear me round , If I am a woman , if she were not her , I did not conjure her .
Tell me , Friar , in what part of my body is my name embedded ?	Tell me , sirs , what in my part of my body is my name ?
Tell me , so I can cut it out of myself .	Tell me , so I can not cut it out of myself .
Are you a man ?	Are you a man ?
Your wild actions resemble the irrational fury of a beast .	Your wild parts Doth not the altitude of a lion .
You have amazed me .	You have naught but words .
I swear by my holy order , I thought you were smarter and more rational than this .	I swear by my holy bones , I thought you were much and more beholding to this .
Have you killed Tybalt ?	Have you killed well ?
Why do you complain about your birth , the heavens , and the earth ?	Why do you cross your breath , the heavens , the earth and the earth ?
You have so much natural talent , but like someone who hoards money , you use none of your talent for the right purpose , not your body , not your love , not your mind .	You have so much approve , And like me but one ) , you use none of your age for your right , Nor your commandment is not your love , not your mind , not your mind .
Get up , man !	Out , ho !
Your Juliet is alive .	Your Honor's is mad .
Tybalt wanted to kill you , but you killed Tybalt .	Known unto thee , but you killed not you .
Be happy that you're alive .	Be happy that thou art alive .
You have the best sorts of happiness to enjoy .	You have the best of wits to endure .
But like a misbehaved , sullen girl , you're whining about your bad luck and your love .	But , like a merry , amazed , Thou art thy hairy news of thy love .
Go be with your love , as it was decided at your wedding .	Go be your love , as it was , at your peril .
Climb up to her bedroom and comfort her .	Dry up to her and comfort her .
Give my regards to your lady , and tell her to hurry everybody in the house to bed .	Give my regards to this lady , And to tell her farewell in the house to bed .
Romeo is coming .	Company is coming .
O Lord , I could stay here all night listening to such good advice .	O Lord , I could stay here at night To comfort my good faith .
Educated men are so impressive !	Certain men are so reputed !
Do so , and tell my sweet to be ready to scold me .	Do so , and tell my sweet to be ready to fetch me .
Here , sir , this is a ring she asked me to give you .	Here , sir , this is a ring she sent me to give you .
Hurry up , it's getting late .	Away , pluck it up .
This makes me feel so much better !	This servitude makes me so much better !
Now get out of here .	Now get thee out of here .
Good night .	Good night .
Everything depends on this : either be out of here before the night watchmen take their positions , or leave in disguise after daybreak .	Better you .
Take a little vacation in Mantua .	Take a little blows in me .
I'll find your servant , and he'll update you now and then on your case as it stands here .	I'll find your servant , and he'll you now , and then your Grace is not afraid of it .
Give me your hand .	Give me your hand .
It's late .	Tis late .
Farewell .	Farewell .
Things have turned out so unluckily , sir , that we haven't had time to convince our daughter to marry you .	Things have turned out so many , sir , that we have had time to our daughter to marry you .
Listen , she loved her cousin Tybalt dearly , and so did I .	Hark , she loved her cousin dearly , and so did I .
Well , we were all born to die .	Well , we were all been born to die .
These times of pain are bad times for romance .	These times of battles are better than for rashness .
Madam , good night .	Madam , good night .
Give my regards to your daughter .	Give my dread counsel to your daughter .
I will .	I will .
Tonight she is shut up in her room , alone with her sadness .	Tonight she is put up in her room , with her alone .
Sir Paris , I'll make a desperate argument for my child's love .	Sir , it , I'll make a desperate humor for my love .
Tell her about my son Paris's love for her .	Tell her of my son love her for her .
And tell her , listen to me , on Wednesday , Wait , What day is today ?	And tell her , soft , to me , ah , What , is 't , Charmian ?
Monday , my lord .	Withdraw , my lord .
Monday !	Begone !
Ha , ha !	Ha , ha !
Do you think it's a good idea to rush ?	Do you think , sir , a good song ?
We shouldn't have too big a celebration , we can invite a friend or two .	We shall have too a crushed fit , we can not hear a friend or two .
Listen , because Tybalt was just killed , people might think that we don't care about his memory as our relative if we have too grand a party .	Enobarbus , preposterous And palter , pretty pig , That , in faith , we would not know his touch , Which we have too shrewd upon a measure .
Therefore we'll have about half a dozen friends to the wedding , and that's it .	Therefore shall have of nothing a more convenient night , And by the best he is .
What do you think about Thursday ?	What do you think of Stanley ?
My lord , I wish Thursday were tomorrow .	My lord , I wish I were here .
Well go on home .	Well go on 't .
Thursday it is , then .	Doubtful it is , then .
Are you going ?	Are you answered ?
It's still a long time until daybreak .	Tis long a long time ere you .
That sound you heard was the It was the lark , the bird that sings at dawn , not the nightingale .	That sound you heard was the matter , the goldsmith that bird at the Nile That comes not bad to be undone .
Look , my love , what are those streaks of light in the clouds parting in the east ?	Look , my love , what are these parts of heaven in the spring of the saints in the skies ?
Night is over , and day is coming .	Intelligence is turned , and day is coming .
That light is not daylight , I know it .	That light is not I , I know it not .
It's some meteor coming out of the sun to light your way to Mantua .	Tis some gone That speaks the day To turn your hand to heaven .
So stay for a while .	So stay a while for my sake .
You don't have to go yet .	You shall have been but yet .
Let me be captured .	Let me be jocund .
Let me be put to death .	Let me be put to death .
I am content , if that's the way you want it .	I am content , if the matter will you do it .
I want to stay more than I want to go .	I am sorry , more more than I am no more .
Come , death , and welcome !	Come , death , and welcome !
Let's talk .	Let's hear .
It's not daylight .	Tis not yet .
It is , it is .	It is , it is .
It's the lark that sings so out of tune , making such harsh noise .	Tis the time that draws out of tune , In such strange encounter .
Some say the lark makes a sweet division between day and night .	Some say the lark without a sweet night and day night .
It's not true because she separates us .	Tis not so long but she beguiled us .
More and more light .	More and more light .
More and more pain for us .	More than more hours for us .
Madam .	Madam .
Nurse ?	Moody ?
Your mother is coming to your bedroom .	Your mother is coming to your uncle's .
Day has broken .	Barnardo is thine .
Then the window lets day in , and life goes out the window .	Then the blow hour in heaven , and life out the moon .
Farewell , farewell !	Farewell , farewell !
Give me one kiss , and I'll go down .	Give me one hand , and I'll go down .
He locks himself up alone in his bedroom , shuts his windows to keep out the beautiful daylight , and makes himself an artificial night .	He faints himself !
My noble uncle , do you know why he acts this way ?	My noble uncle , do you know That he hath this king ?
I don't know , and he won't tell me .	I pray you , and he will tell me .
Have you done everything you could to make him tell you the reason ?	Have you done 't you could to make him tell you the reason ?
I hope you're lucky enough to hear the true story by sticking around .	I hope thee not near the season Wherein I found thee by the season .
Are you gone like that , my love , my lord ?	Are you gone that , my lord , my love ?
Oh , by this count I'll be many years older before I see my Romeo again .	Oh , by this wood shall be many years ere I see my Thisbe's tent .
Farewell !	Farewell !
I won't miss any chance to send my love to you .	I shall not jump upon this cause To visit my brother .
Oh , do you think we'll ever meet again ?	Oh , do you think That we may meet again ?
Oh God , I have a soul that predicts evil things !	O God , I have a soul that dreadful hadst been false !
Now that you are down there , you look like someone dead in the bottom of a tomb .	Now that you are there , you look like me dead in the mind of a tomb .
Either my eyesight is failing me , or you look pale .	See my train is upward , and you look pale .
And trust me , love , you look pale to me too .	And honor , love me , you look so pale to me .
Sadness takes away our color .	Tempt yourselves away our part .
Goodbye , Goodbye !	Sola , sola !
Oh luck , luck .	O morrow , lady .
Everyone says you can't make up your mind .	Yonder that you will not make your peace .
I hope maybe then you'll send him back home soon .	I hope yet Will not meet him back again .
Who's that calling ?	Who's that ?
Is it my mother ?	Is it my mother ?
What strange reason could she have for coming here ?	What strange reason could she have sent for here ?
What's going on , Juliet ?	Wherefore to Dover , ?
Madam , I am not well .	Madam , I am not well .
Will you cry about your cousin's death forever ?	Will you not take your charge to Hero ?
Are you trying to wash him out of his grave with tears ?	Canst thou deny me to cut off his grave with tears ?
If you could , you couldn't bring him back to life .	If you could , you shall bring him back to life .
So stop crying .	So comes you .
A little bit of grief shows a lot of love .	A little of sorrow Must not a note of love .
Let me keep weeping for such a great loss .	Let me keep weeping for such a great loss .
You will feel the loss , but the man you weep for will feel nothing .	You will not feel the woman , but the man you weep for worth nothing .
Feeling the loss like this , I can't help but weep for him forever .	Alack the loss of mine , I will not weep for him but I thank him .
Well , girl , you're weeping not for his death as much as for the fact that the villain who killed him is still alive .	Well , girl , O Clarence , for his father may as the gentleman that called the word of him who is still alive .
What villain , madam ?	What villain , madam ?
That villain , Romeo .	That villain , thou art .
That's because the murderer is alive .	Farewell , the murderer is alive .
Yes , madam , he lies beyond my reach .	Ay , madam , he lies upon my handiwork .
I wish that no one could avenge my cousin's death except me !	I wish that no one could not suspect my soul For me !
Stop crying .	Abide within .
I'll send a man to Mantua , where that exiled rogue is living .	I'll send a man to Adriana , where that is harsh to cherish .
And then , I hope , you'll be satisfied .	And then , I hope , I am satisfied .
I'll never be satisfied with Romeo until I see him .	I'll never be satisfied with thee till I see him .
Madam , if you can find a man to deliver the poison , I'll mix it myself so that Romeo will sleep quietly soon after he drinks it .	Madam , if you can find a man to play the world , I'll sign it , I'll that so sleep that I will return again at his health .
I want to take the love I had for my cousin and take it out on the body of the man who killed him .	I do beseech the love I gave my husband And take it on the body of the man who killed the man of him .
Find out the way , and I'll find the right man .	Find out the way , and I'll find the right man .
But now I have joyful news for you , girl .	But now I have ta'en company for you , sir .
And it's good to have joy in such a joyless time .	And 'tis good to have such a joy in such a time .
Please tell me .	Hear me .
Well , well , you have a careful father , child .	Well , well , you have a careful father , child .
Madam , tell me quickly , what day is that ?	Madam , tell me , what is 't , is that ?
Indeed , my child , at Saint Peter's Church early Thursday morning , the gallant , young , and noble gentleman Count Paris will happily make you a joyful bride .

Have you told her our decision ?	Have you not told her so ?
I wish the fool were dead and married to her grave !	I wish the fool were dead and married to her ear !
How can this be ?	How can this be ?
Isn't she proud of such a match ?	Was she not such a match of ?
Doesn't she realize how unworthy she is of the gentleman we have found to be her bridegroom ?	Doth she not think how she is the gentleman of the Tower To have her abide to be her ?
But I am thankful that you have found it .	But I am weary that you have found it .
What is this ?	What is this ?
What is this fuzzy logic ?	What is this leaden casket ?
What is this ?	What is this ?
I hear you say "proud" and "I thank you , " and then "no thank you" and "not proud , " you spoiled little girl .	I hear you say "Come" and negligence you , and for how gentle husbandry and humble , " Too you may withdraw yourself .
You disgust me , you little bug !	You talk , you rogue , no more !

Oh God ! , Oh Nurse , how can this be stopped ?	O God ! , O heaven , how shall this be compassed ?
My husband is alive on earth , my vows of marriage are in heaven .	My husband is now on earth , my affairs of England are in heaven .
How can I bring those promises back down to earth , unless my husband sends them back down to me by dying and going to heaven ?	How can I bring thee all down forth , For God's authority , bid my husband put them down to me by Egypt and art to heaven ?
Give me comfort .	Give me comfort .

Madam , an eagle does not have eyes as green , as quick , and as fair as the eyes of Paris .	Madam , an arrant knave do not have as bravely as great , and quick as the As of the sort .
Curse my very heart , but I think you should be happy in this second marriage , because it's better than your first .	Curse my heart , And I should be happy , And in this happy hour I would be sad , And half your office .
Even if it's not better , your first marriage is over .	Even if not be your best , Antony shall be guilty of .

I made my father angry , so I went to Friar Lawrence's cell to confess and be forgiven .	I made my father angry , so I went to cope withal , confess my conscience and be not acquainted .
Alright , I will .	Unwilling , I will .
Oh , that most wicked fiend !	Oh , that most wicked and unnatural !

If I answered that question , I'd be making confession to you .	If I answered not , That would be served to you .
Don't deny to him that you love me .	Therefore he shall not love him that you love .
I'll confess to you that I love him .	I'll confess that I love thee so .
You will also confess , I'm sure , that you love me .	You will also confess , It is , that love you me .
If I do so , it will mean more if I say it behind your back than if I say it to your face .	If I do so , it will say I say if I live in your back : if I say it is your love .
You poor soul , your face has suffered many tears .	You poor soul , your face hath worn many times .

Love will give me strength , and strength will help me accomplish this plan .	Love will give me strength , and strength will help me In this case .

How sweet it would be to actually have the woman I love , when merely thinking about love makes me so happy .	How long would be it to the woman I have , I love when , when thou didst love me so .
Do you have news from Verona ! , What is it , Balthasar ?	Do you have news from thee !
Do you bring me a letter from the friar ?	Do you bring me a letter from the letter ?
How is my wife ?	How is my wife ?
Is my father well ?	Is my father well ?
How is my Juliet ?	How is my dearest ?
I ask that again because nothing can be wrong if she is well .	I ask that again And speak to her , if she be well .
Then she is well , and nothing is wrong .	Then she is well , and nothing is done .
Her body sleeps in the Capulet tomb , and her immortal soul lives with the angels in heaven .	Her body sleeps in the earth , And her cursed soul looks with the pale in heaven .
I saw her buried in her family's tomb , and then I came here to tell you the news .	I saw her buried in her closet , and then I came hither to tell you the news .

You wouldn't tell a sick man he "seriously" has to make his will , it would just make him worse .	You would not tell a man he hath laid to make his will , it would not make him worse .
Seriously , cousin , I love a woman .	Tut , cousin , I love a woman .
Then you were right on target .	Then you were gone on 't .
The woman I love is beautiful .	The woman I love is fair .
A beautiful target is the one that gets hit the fastest .	A fair Bianca is the one that hath the same points of the world .
Well , you're not on target there .	Well , thou art not on her company .
Yes she has , and by keeping celibate , she wastes her beauty .	Yes she hath , and by what she became , she kicked her father .
She's too beautiful and too wise to deserve heaven's blessing by making me despair .	Bear him too hot and damned To give me choice by seeming to me .
Take my advice .	Take my office .
Don't think about her .	Do not so .
Teach me to forget to think !	Teach me to forget , and to the world , That I may not live to be so much as I am , I am sure to do it .
Is it really true ?	Is it not true ?
Then I rebel against you , stars !	Then I against thee , sirrah , ho !
You know where I live .	You know where I live .
Get me some ink and paper , and hire some horses to ride .	Get me some ink and paper , And burn some hundred instruments .

As I remember , this should be the house .	As I remember , this should be the house .
Today's a holiday , so the beggar's shop is shut .	Maintain a train , That the dead hath set out .
Hey !	Affection !
Pharmacist !	Hoo !
Who's that calling so loud ?	Who's that so gently ?
Come here , man .	Come hither , man .
I see that you are poor .	I see 't you are poor .
Here are forty ducats .	Here are some widow .
You're this poor and wretched and still afraid to die ?	Art thou this poor and living duke we shall die ?
Your cheeks are thin because of hunger .	Your asses are very deceived , of the chameleon's dish .
I can see in your eyes that you're starving .	I can not see your eyes in that thou didst feign .
The world is not your friend , and neither is the law .	The world is not your friend , and speak the law .
The world doesn't make laws to make you rich .	The world shall make thee make good counsel .
I pay you because you're poor , not because you want me to buy this .	I am bound , And thou art not my daughter , thus thou shalt hear this .
Holy Franciscan Friar !	Alack , alack !
Brother , hey !	Brother , ho !
That sounds like the voice of Friar John .	That voice is the word of Don John .
Welcome back from Mantua .	Welcome back from hence .
What does Romeo say ?	What sayest thou now ?
Or , if he wrote down his thoughts , give me his letter .	Or , if he came down his bed , give him his letter .
I couldn't go to Mantua because I was stuck there .	I shall go to thee And I was borne there .
Then who took my letter to Romeo ?	Then who took my arm thus ?
Unhappy fortune !	Despair !
Brother , I'll go and bring it to you .	Brother , I'll go and bring it to you .
Now I must go to the tomb alone .	Now I must go to the tomb of Antony .
Within three hours Juliet will wake up .	Within three hours will wake up .
But I'll write again to Mantua , and I'll keep her in my cell until Romeo comes .	But I'll write again to my lodging , And keep her in my tent And stay upon me .

I can only repeat what I've said before .	I can not wish what I have said .
My daughter is still very young .	My daughter is still most honest .
She's not even fourteen years old .	Bear not so hard , yet .
Girls younger than she often marry and become happy mothers .	Rather so simple That she should make honest counsel .
Girls who marry so young grow up too soon .	Plain that I so long wake up too much .
But go ahead and charm her , gentle Paris ; make her love you .	But go and importune her and gentle counsel , Draw her till fair love you .

Everybody knows I'm a nice piece of flesh .	Temperance knows not a sweet sense of flesh .
It's a good thing you're not a piece of fish .	Tis a good thing , A more of a piece of ale .
You're Pull out your tool now .	One inch of your mouth now .
I have my naked sword out .	I have my sword forth .
Come over here , nurse .	Come hither , sirrah .
Who is that gentleman ?	Who is 't that hinders you ?
He is the son and heir of old Tiberio .	He is the son and heir of old age .
Who's the one who's going out the door right now ?	Doth the villain o ' th ' earth ?
Well , that one , I think , is young Petruchio .	Well , that one , I think , is young indeed .
I don't know his name .	I know his name .
Go ask .	Go ask .
What's this ?	What's this ?
What's this ?	What's this ?
The strangers are all gone .	The sky are all gone .
But he has to make his speeches of love to a woman who's supposed to be his enemy .	But he hath given his speeches to a woman of a woman To be his own enemy .
And Juliet's just as much in love as he , but she has even less opportunity to meet her lover .	And therefore as much in love as she , As he hath even less bound to meet her lover .
But love gives them power , and time gives them the chance to meet , sweetening the extreme danger with intense pleasure .	But love gives them power , And bring the time to them again , To the mart tackle the wrestling with loud .
Can I go away while my heart stays here ?	Can I go then When my heart stays for here ?
I bet he slipped away and went home to bed .	I warrant he lay away And spoke to bed .
He ran this way and jumped over this orchard wall .	He sups there and this place Is out of this wood .
Call to him , Mercutio .	Call to him , officer .
I'll conjure him as if I were summoning a spirit .	I'll neigh as if I were a spirit of a bachelor .
Romeo !	Hoo !
Show yourself in the form of a sigh .	Show 's in the form of a song .
Speak one rhyme , and I'll be satisfied .	Speak one , and I'll be satisfied .
Just cry out , "Ah me ! " Just say "love" and "dove." Say just one lovely word to my good friend	Nor cry , out !
If he hears you , you'll make him angry .	If he do not , you shall make him angry .
What I'm saying can't anger him .	What was thy fear of him .
The things I'm saying are fair and honest .	The things is thus fair and honest .
His love is blind , so it belongs in the dark .	His love is so dull , it is in the dark .
If love is blind , it can't hit the target .	If love is mad , it will not hear the course .
Now he'll sit under a Let's go .	Now he'll sit i ' th ' midst .
There's no point in looking for him if he doesn't want to be found .	There's no offense in him for him if he shall be brought to know .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .	It is the brooch , and the remainder is the moon .
Virginity makes her look sick and green .	Better makes her joy and blind .
Let it go .	Let it go .
Oh , there's my lady !	O , there's my lady !
Oh , it is my love .	Oh , it is my love .
Oh , I wish she knew how much I love her .	Oh , I wish she knew how much I love her heartily .
She's talking , but she's not saying anything .	Bear him , but thus I am not .
So what ?	So what ?
Her eyes are saying something .	Her eyes are not jealous .
She's not talking to me .	Bear not me to me .
Two of the brightest stars in the whole sky had to go away on business , and they're asking her eyes to twinkle in their places until they return .	Two of the stars in the sky were more To put on them , and they do teach her eyes to see their husbands When they return their ways .
If her eyes were in the night sky , they would shine so brightly through space that birds would start singing , thinking her light was the light of day .	If her eyes were in the night they were dead , they would shine through them that afterwards would couch , considering her light the light of nothing .
Look how she leans her hand on her cheek .	Look how she rubs her hand on her cheek .
Oh , I wish I was the glove on that hand so that I could touch that cheek .	Oh , I am I wish the glove of that hand That I could touch that 'twas twice .
Oh , my !	O my follies !
Who are you ?	Who are you ?
I hate my name , dear saint , because my name is your enemy .	I hate my name , dear lord , And my name is your enemy .
Aren't you Romeo ?	Whither wander you ?
And aren't you a Montague ?	And art thou a fellow ?
Tell me , how did you get in here ?	Tell me , how came you here in here ?
And why did you come ?	And wherefore did you come ?
If any of my relatives find you here they'll kill you because of who you are .	If any of my show you here And here I will devise you here of you .
Therefore your relatives are no obstacle .	Therefore your Honor are no stronger than it .
If they see you , they'll murder you .	If they see you , they'll murder you .
Just look at me kindly , and I'm invincible against their hatred .	Nor look at me , and therefore am their fond pageant .
I'd give anything to keep them from seeing you here .	To give thee thus from this delight And ever to thee .
I'd rather they killed me than have to live without your love .	To feed me now To have been rich enough to thy love .
Otherwise , you'd see me blushing about the things you've heard me say tonight .	Marry , Could not me see the truth What you've heard me say the wrong .
Do you love me ?	Do you love me ?
I know you'll say "yes , " and I'll believe you .	I know not now , " and I'll not believe you .
What should I swear by ?	What should I swear by ?
Don't swear at all .	Therefore I needs see .
But if you have to swear , swear by your wonderful self , which is the god I worship like an idol , and then I'll believe you .	But if you have , sir , swear by your poor self , which is the god I share for , and then I'll believe thee .
If my heart's dear love , Well , don't swear .	If my heart's love , dear husband , do not .
Although you bring me joy , I can't take joy in this exchange of promises tonight .	Masters , give me joy , I will not take joy in this discord of life .
Our love , which right now is like a flower bud in the summer air , may turn out to be a beautiful flower by the next time we meet .	Our love , which is now come upon a church Troilus 'twixt the air , may turn out , to be a fair flower by the next time we meet .
I hope you enjoy the same sweet peace and rest I feel in my heart .	I hope you do not stand the peace And weep in peace .
Oh , are you going to leave me so unsatisfied ?	O , art thou so hasty to me ?
What satisfaction could you possibly have tonight ?	What tidings could you have legs tonight ?
I pledged my love to you before you asked me to .	I am my love to you before you promised me to .
Yet I wish I could take that promise back , so I had it to give again .	Yet I wish I could take that promise , so I had it to give again .
You would take it back ?	You would take it back ?
Why would you do that , my love ?	Why would you do that , my love ?
Only to be generous and give it to you once more .	Only to be ill and give it to thee once more .
But I'm wishing for something I already have .	But 'tis for I something I have none .
My generosity to you is as limitless as the sea , and my love is as deep .	My resolution's placed , as you may have the sea As well as my love is as high .
I hear a noise inside .	I hear a noise that's making the pass of the state .
Sweet Montague , be true .	Sweet , be true .
Stay here for a moment .	Stay here for a moment .
I'll come back .	I'll come back .
Oh , blessed , blessed night !	O blessed condition , ho !
Because it's dark out , I'm afraid all this is just a dream , too sweet to be real .	Yet 'tis foul , be brief , all this is but a dream , To too dear a moiety of mine .
Three words , dear Romeo , and then it's good night for real .	Tush , words , dear , and then 'tis good for night .
Don't worry about me .	Do not torment me .
I Let's not break the law by starting a fight .	I will not break the law by a fight .
Let them start something .	Let them go justly .
I'll frown at them as they pass by , and they can react however they want .	I'll frown at them till they pass , And they are sudden That they do lack .
You mean however they dare .	You mean they might not .
I'll bite my thumb at them .	I'll not my shoe at them .
Hey , are you biting your thumb at us ?	Sblood , dost thou jeer at thy cell ?
I'm biting my thumb .	Thou hast my elder .
Are you biting your thumb at us ?	Are you your manners at us ?
Are you trying to start a fight ?	Are you crept hither to a fight ?
Start a fight ?	Woo't thou fight ?
No , sir .	No , sir .
Tomorrow I'll send the messenger .	Tomorrow I'll send the messenger .
My soul depends on it , A thousand times good night .	My soul depends on it , A thousand times good night .
Leaving you is a thousand times worse than being near you .	Sometime you are a thousand times worse than being by you .
Oh , I wish I could make a My soul is calling out my name .	Oh , I wish I could make a soul The eldest son of my name .
The sound of lovers calling each others names through the night is silver-sweet .	The sound of lovers makes us best pass The night upon the night .
Romeo !	Hoo !
My baby hawk ?	My letters ?
What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you ?	What time tomorrow should I send a messenger to you ?
By nine o'clock .	By nine o'clock .
I won't fail .	I will translate .
From now until then seems like twenty years .	From now simply see it is sober .
I have forgotten why I called you back .	I have forgotten what I came back for you .
Let me stand here until you remember your reason .	Let me stand here Till you remember your reason .
I'll forget that I have any home besides this spot right here .	I'll forget that I have no further heels , And this is gone .
It's almost morning .	Tis he .
He lets the bird hop a little from his hand and then yanks him back by a string .	He hath the melancholy melancholy of a man's hand And then his neck hold him by a scarf .
I wish I was your bird .	I am I thy bird .
My sweet , so do I .	My sweet love , so do I .
But I would kill you by petting you too much .	But I would kill thee by you too much .
Good night , good night .	Good night , good night .
Parting is such sweet sorrow that I'll say good night until tonight becomes tomorrow .	Twas my pretty sorrow that I love night tonight than let us live tonight .
I hope you sleep peacefully .	I hope you sleep not .
I wish I were Sleep and Peace , so I could spend the night with you .	I wish I were and were tall , I could not spend the night with you .
Now I'll go see my priest , to ask for his help and tell him about my good luck .	Now shall I go , my lord , To give his help and tell him my good news .
Darkness is stumbling out of the sun's path like a drunk man .	Better is out o ' th ' moonshine of a man .
Now , before the sun comes up and burns away the dew , I have to fill this basket of mine with poisonous weeds and medicinal flowers .	Now , before the sun comes up and behold the night I fill , And with the imperial votaress of this pelleted storm And braggart with the sickly fire .
The Earth is nature's mother and also nature's tomb .	The sweetest name is unblessed and she hath murdered his folly .
From the Earth's womb , many different sorts of plants and animals come forth , and the Earth provides her children with many excellent forms of nourishment .	From the highest hour , The many blasts of embossed sores and drowsy instruments , And the remainder passed with her most wounded piece of garbage .
Herbs , plants , and stones possess great power .	Budge , and stones , and power therefore great power .
There is nothing on Earth that is so evil that it does not provide the earth with some special quality .	There is nothing on 't , that is thus so terrible that we do not play the cruel o ' th ' evil .
Virtue turns to vice if it's misused .	Men must be pinched For poor'st diminutives .
Inside the little rind of this weak flower , there is both poison and powerful medicine .	Plucking the world of this weak parts , Who is both still curst and mighty blood .
There are two opposite elements in everything , in men as well as in herbs , good and evil .	There are two souls in everything , men in Arabia are as well as good , in good and evil .
When evil is dominant , death soon kills the body like cancer .	When evil is , This doth curse the body With the flocks I have .
Good morning , father .	Good morrow , father .
God bless you .	God bless you .
Who greets me so early in the morning ?	Who chooseth me will so walk in the morning ?
Young man , something's wrong if you're getting out of bed this early .	Young man , shepherd , if thou dost hear , One sweet bed still .
Every old man has worries , and worried men never get any sleep , but young men shouldn't have a care in the world .	Idle old man hath appointed men , and therefore repute us never , but therefore , honest men shall have a care in the world .
They should get to bed early and get plenty of sleep .	They should to bed Be early and fire of thee .
Therefore , the fact that you're awake this early tells me you've been upset with some anxiety .	Therefore , the worm of law doth know this taper Hath cost me some sway .
If that's not the case , then this must be the answer : You , Romeo , have not been to bed tonight .	If not , that's the case , then the whole answer should be , You understand , have not to bed tonight .
Your last guess is right .	Your last cock is well .
I enjoyed a sweeter rest than sleep .	I prithee a fearful sleep may sleep .
With Rosaline , father ?	With whence , father ?
That's good , my boy .	That's not my kind , boy .
But where have you been ?	But where have you been ?
I'll tell you before you have to ask me again .	I'll tell you before you have spoke to me again .
You have the sacred power to cure both of us .	You have the power to raise peace of us .
I carry no hatred , holy man , because my request will benefit my enemy .	I carry no less. , But holy man , my girl will fly my enemy .
