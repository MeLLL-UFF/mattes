Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift .	Wait except someone who knows it .
Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set On the fair daughter of rich Capulet .	Then please know my heart's love is set on the beautiful daughter of broken Beatrice .
As mine on hers , so hers is set on mine , And all combined , save what thou must combine By holy marriage .	As mine own faces , so lovely on war , they must have been punished for heaven , oh , when she wakes up into holy empty .
When and where and how We met , we wooed and made exchange of vow , I'll tell thee as we pass , but this I pray : That thou consent to marry us today .	When we're sat and where we met , who made we divide , and of fact , we can tell me as soon as I know , but who doesn't marry you to marry us today .
Holy Saint Francis , what a change is here !	Conquer , "That , a riddle , what is this !
Is Rosaline , whom thou didst love so dear , So soon forsaken ?	Is everyone , whom you love so much , then you'll be tongue-tied ?
Young men's love then lies Not truly in their hearts , but in their eyes .	Young people love enjoy everything they said in their hearts , but in their eyes .
The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears , Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears .	The sun means to protect me from your happy plan , we'll make my old thoughts in my ears .
Lo , here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit Of an old tear that is not washed off yet .	Right on , now .
If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine , Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline .	If she's cheated on me and these actions , and these actions were all for these illusions .
And art thou changed ?	And you're not changed ?
Pronounce this sentence then : Women may fall when there's no strength in men .	Everything that await kings are just beginners when they have no strength in such men .
Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline .	I've told you everything to accept for loving .
For doting , not for loving , pupil mine .	For she's not loyal , for loving me .
And badest me bury love .	And we'll kill me .
Not in a grave , To lay one in , another out to have .	Not in a grave , we'll have one in another , to stop .
I pray thee , chide not .	I don't know what you're talking about .
The other did not so .	The other just told you .
Oh , she knew well Thy love did read by rote , that could not spell .	Oh , she knew it was true love by showing me that could only swear on it .
But come , young waverer , come , go with me , In one respect I'll thy assistant be , For this alliance may so happy prove To turn your households ' rancor to pure love .	Yes , hurry , hurry , along with me , and I'll go home with you , as this one may be happy about your efforts , which may happen to hide your thoughts .
Oh , let us hence .	Oh , let us go .
I stand on sudden haste .	I stand on board yourself .
Wisely and slow .	Large and increasing .
They stumble that run fast .	They run that then .
Where the devil should this Romeo be ?	Where the devil should this be compassed ?
Came he not home tonight ?	Wasn't he coming home tonight ?
Not to his father's .	Not to his father's house .
I spoke with his man .	I spoke with his man .
Why , that same pale hard-hearted wench , that Rosaline , Torments him so , that he will sure run mad .	Why , that same pale bastard , that generous ghost , that he sees it , so he can't help himself .
Tybalt , the kinsman to old Capulet , Hath sent a letter to his father's house .	Finally , the old priest to act sent a message to his house .
A challenge , on my life .	A second pain on my life .
Romeo will answer it .	Bloodshed will pay it .
Any man that can write may answer a letter .	Any man who can write is just a letter .
Nay , he will answer the letter's master , how he dares , being dared .	Yes , he won't answer the priest , how he wants , being overjoyed .
Alas , poor Romeo !	Alas , poor Glou-cester !
And is he a man to encounter Tybalt ?	And is he a man to copy honey ?
Why , what is Tybalt ?	Why , what is that ?
The what ?	The what ?
Without his roe , like a dried herring .	Without his nose , like a dried acorn .
O flesh , flesh , how art thou fishified !	Oh , flesh , oh , how nice things is !
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in .	Now he's for the same time that surrounds them in .
Good morrow to you both .	Good morning to you both .
What counterfeit did I give you ?	What did I ask for you ?
The slip , sir , the slip .	The criminal , sir , the friar's plan .
Can you not conceive ?	Can you imagine something ?
Nay , I am the very pink of courtesy .	Yes , I am the very good-natured sir .
I serve as good a man as you .	I serve as good a man as you .
No better .	No better .
Well , sir .	Well , sir .
You lie .	You lie .
You know not what you do .	You don't know what you want .
What , art thou drawn among these heartless hinds ?	What , aren't you originally from Corinth , and you ?
Come between us , good Benvolio .	Come on , good us , good .
My wits faints .	My name's Gloucester .
Switch and spurs , switch and spurs , or I'll cry a match .	Snip and love" , and it's nearby , I'll cry a match .
Nay , if our wits run the wild-goose chase , I am done , for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of thy wits than , I am sure , I have in my whole five .	Yes , if our army comes to the point , I am glad I'm going to take you in the more of your song than the one of your daughter , I am sure I have in my whole mood .
Was I with you there for the goose ?	Was I with you there for the goose ?
Thou wast never with me for anything when thou wast not there for the goose .	I've never been for it because they had even there for the world .
I will bite thee by the ear for that jest .	I can't fight you from the first for that question .
Nay , good goose , bite not .	Yes , good ones , please .
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting .	Your wit is a very nasty meaning .
It is a most sharp sauce .	It is a most appropriate time .
And is it not well served into a sweet goose ?	And is it completely stopped to be a sweet girl ?
Oh , here's a wit of cheveril , that stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad !	Oh , here's a lot of wit , that it's an odd snake to be an ungrateful person !
I stretch it out for that word "broad , " which , added to the goose , proves thee far and wide a broad goose .	I swear it is out for that word , " which , to whip the rabbit , are far between her and a puppy .
Why , is not this better now than groaning for love ?	Why , are you really this better than evil for love ?
Now art thou sociable .	Now you're talking about it .
Now art thou Romeo .	Now you're talking about it .
Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large .	He's here whenever you have sold your own dinner .
Oh , thou art deceived .	Oh , you're absolutely right .
I would have made it short , for I was come to the whole depth of my tale , and meant , indeed , to occupy the argument no longer .	I would have made it short , for I was going to take the whole barrel of my story , and meant to admit the world no longer .
Here's goodly gear .	Here's my nephew .
Two , two , a shirt and a smock .	Two , two , a nice and a servant .
Peter !	Coward !
Anon !	Again !
My fan , Peter .	My name's Roderigo , calm down .
God ye good morrow , gentlemen .	God bless you , good gentlemen .
God ye good e'en , fair gentlewoman .	God bless you , good fair .
Is it good e'en ?	Is it good luck ?
Tis no less , I tell you , for the bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick of noon .	It's no less , I tell you , for the earldom of Hereford and the now is the smallest of them cries .
Out upon you !	Get out !
What a man are you ?	What a man are you ?
One , gentlewoman , that God hath made , himself to mar .	You're a farmer here , who can make himself , to worry .
By my troth , it is well said .	By my future , it is well said .
For himself to mar , " quoth he ?	For himself to get married , but he ?
Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young Romeo ?	Gentlemen , can any of you tell me where I may find the young idea ?
I can tell you , but young Romeo will be older when you have found him than he was when you sought him .	I can tell you , but young night will be older when you have him once because he was when you saved him .
I am the youngest of that name , for fault of a worse .	I am the name of that name , for only a share of worse .
You say well .	You say well .
Yea , is the worst well ?	Really , is the worst Kent ?
Very well took , i ' faith , wisely , wisely .	Very well , it's what you've said , good madam .
She will indite him to some supper .	She will go to bed to his house .
So ho !	So ho !
What hast thou found ?	What have you found ?
Romeo , will you come to your father's ?	Yeah , will you come to your father's ?
We'll to dinner , thither .	We'll go to dinner , Jessica .
I will follow you .	I won't follow you .
A gentleman , Nurse , that loves to hear himself talk , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand to in a month .	A gentleman , that loves , to hear himself talk to know , and will speak more in a minute than he will stand in a month .
An he speak any thing against me , I'll take him down , an he were lustier than he is , and twenty such Jacks .	As he got any thing against me , I'll take him down , he was an animal for he is getting like a military weapon .
And if I can not , I'll find those that shall .	And if I can , I'll find you out that I'll go .
Scurvy knave !	Wait !
I am none of his flirt-gills .	I am looking at his own .
I am none of his skains-mates .	I am tired of his favorites .
I saw no man use you at his pleasure .	I saw no man at his shop to watch .
If I had , my weapon should quickly have been out , I warrant you .	If I had , my speech should have been quickly out , I won't bother you .
I dare draw as soon as another man if I see occasion in a good quarrel and the law on my side .	I dare pull too as soon as I say if I see a good king and a fellow who can on my side .
Now , afore God , I am so vexed that every part about me quivers .	Now , God , I tell you that it's a bit about this letter .
Scurvy knave !	Wait !
Nurse , commend me to thy lady and mistress .	Meanwhile , listen to me and your wife .
I protest unto thee , Good heart , and i ' faith , I will tell her as much .	I wanted to see you , ma'am , and I won't tell her , I will tell her as much .
Lord , Lord , she will be a joyful woman .	Lord , Lord , she will be a cruel woman .
What wilt thou tell her , Nurse ?	What can you tell her , tell her ?
Thou dost not mark me .	I'm not glad you are talking about .
And there she shall at Friar Lawrence ' cell Be shrived and married .	And there I'll also be married at poetry until you're so smart .
And stay , good Nurse .	And stay , good advice .
Behind the abbey wall Within this hour my man shall be with thee And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair , Which to the high top-gallant of my joy Must be my convoy in the secret night .	Hurry !
Farewell .	Farewell .
Be trusty , and I'll quit thy pains .	I'm ordering you , and I'll stop your money .
Farewell .	Farewell .
Commend me to thy mistress .	Take me to your mistress .
Now God in heaven bless thee !	Now God forgive that I'm scared of you !
Hark you , sir .	Listen to me , sir .
What sayst thou , my dear Nurse ?	What do you want to kill my dear niece ?
Is your man secret ?	Is your master become ?
Did you ne'er hear say , "Two may keep counsel , putting one away" ?	Did you accompany him , please , keep fooling around , and one ?
Warrant thee , my man's as true as steel .	Ma'am , my dear as you are as beautiful as steel .
Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest lady. , Lord , Lord !	Well , sir , my mistress is the sweetest , Lord , Lord , Lord !
when 'twas a little prating thing. , Oh , there is a nobleman in town , one Paris , that would fain lay knife aboard , but she , good soul , had as lief see a toad , a very toad , as see him .	Maybe , it's a little one." "No , a spendthrift , there is a single protrusion in one town , that "many" could mean "it's stones , but she was , oh , as a half-formed thought , can see a sin as very thought .
I anger her sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer man .	I anger her father and tell her that is the husband's man who stole a man .
But , I'll warrant you , when I say so , she looks as pale as any clout in the versal world .	But I'll bet you , I'll say that , so she looks as pale as any winter in the world as any snake .
Doth not Ay , Nurse , what of that ?	Doesn't me know what happened to me , Horatio ?
Both with an Ah , mocker , that's the dog's name .	Both with an idiot , that's the name that's the real name .
Commend me to thy lady .	Take me to your lady .
Ay , a thousand times. , Peter !	Yes , a thousand , cowardly , oh !
Anon !	Again !
Before and apace .	Before and listen .
The clock struck nine when I did send the Nurse .	The clock struck the time I saw the general's ensign .
Perchance she can not meet him .	Maybe she can do him soon .
That's not so .	That's not necessary .
Oh , she is lame !	Oh , she is wonderful !
Love's heralds should be thoughts , Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams , Driving back shadows over louring hills .	Meanwhile !
Now is the sun upon the highmost hill Of this day's journey , and from nine till twelve Is three long hours , yet she is not come .	Now I'm afraid of the wedding ocean : the ambitious tree , and from the gallows three months waves long , yet she is not angry .
Had she affections and warm youthful blood , She would be as swift in motion as a ball .	Pay it coldly .
My words would bandy her to my sweet love , And his to me .	My words would belong to her sweet love , and his sweet to me .
But old folks , many feign as they were dead , Unwieldy , slow , heavy , and pale as lead .	But old days , as many as they were dead , oh , dark , cold , and look as pale .
O God , she comes. , O honey Nurse , what news ?	Oh God , she doesn't dare you , Oh , what news ?
Hast thou met with him ?	Has it come with him ?
Send thy man away .	Send your man away .
Peter , stay at the gate .	Peter , stay at the gate .
Now , good sweet Nurse , O Lord , why look'st thou sad ?	Now , good sweet brother-in-law , Lord , why are you sad ?
Though news be sad , yet tell them merrily .	Though news be sad , don't tell them anything .
If good , thou shamest the music of sweet news By playing it to me with so sour a face .	If good , you're the music of two news with me into going to meet with me so quickly .
I am aweary .	I am insulting me .
Give me leave awhile .	Give me leave awhile .
Fie , how my bones ache !	Stop , how my bones are tired !
I would thou hadst my bones and I thy news .	I would have my luck and I want your news .
Can you not stay awhile ?	Can you stay awhile ?
Do you not see that I am out of breath ?	Do you see that I'm out of breath for me ?
How art thou out of breath when thou hast breath To say to me that thou art out of breath ?	How are you out of breath when you're married to me that you'll say to me that I'm out of breath ?
The excuse that thou dost make in this delay Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse .	The excuse that you are in having a long mood to go tell the story you promised to do .
Is thy news good , or bad ?	Is your news good , or bad ?
Answer to that .	Answer that to do .
Say either , and I'll stay the circumstance .	Say either , and I'll stay the one .
Let me be satisfied .	Let me be satisfied .
Is 't good or bad ?	Is that good or bad ?
Well , you have made a simple choice .	Well , you have made a simple tongue .
You know not how to choose a man .	You know how you'll have a reputation to a man .
Romeo !	Damn it !
No , not he , though his face be better than any man's , yet his leg excels all men's , and for a hand and a foot and a body , though they be not to be talked on , yet they are past compare .	No , not if he was his face , no better than his heart , yet his huge qualities , and I've been a Jack and a beard for a body , though they don't be able to be yet on , even though they are past .
He is not the flower of courtesy , but , I'll warrant him , as gentle as a lamb .	He is not the air of the duke , but I'll bet him , as gentle as a whirlpool .
Go thy ways , wench .	Go your sword , sir .
Serve God .	Hello tonight .
What , have you dined at home ?	What , have you getting at home ?
No , no .	No , no .
But all this did I know before .	But all this did I know before .
What says he of our marriage ?	What does he think of our marriage ?
What of that ?	What of that ?
My back a ' t ' other side .	My back on a magic trip .
Ah , my back , my back !	Ah , my back , my back !
I ' faith , I am sorry that thou art not well .	I wish I am , I wish you really do that .
Sweet , sweet , sweet Nurse , tell me , what says my love ?	Sweet , sweet , sweet , tell me what about what my love do ?
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , and a courteous , and a kind , and a handsome , and , I warrant , a virtuous , Where is your mother ?	Your love , like an honest animal , and a kind of a weak , and a handsome , and a fortune-teller , a needy , a virtuous , how is your mother ?
Where is my mother ?	Where is my mother ?
Why , she is within .	Why , she is moving .
Where should she be ?	Where should she be ?
How oddly thou repliest !	How nice things !
Your love says , like an honest gentleman , 'Where is your mother ?	Your love says , like an honest gentleman , is your mother ?
O God's lady dear , Are you so hot ?	Oh , dear lady , don't you think so ?
Marry , come up , I trow .	Yes , come up , I swear .
Is this the poultice for my aching bones ?	Is this the job for my brother's sake ?
Henceforward do your messages yourself .	We're sorry for your troubles .
Here's such a coil .	Here's such a stupid man .
Come , what says Romeo ?	Come on , what says ?
Have you got leave to go to shrift today ?	Have you got to leave to Desdemona to Venice ?
I have .	I have .
Then hie you hence to Friar Lawrence's cell .	Then please go around you to single rules .
There stays a husband to make you a wife .	There isn't a husband to make a wife a wife .
Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks .	Now that's the whole tree in your blood .
They'll be in scarlet straight at any news .	They'll be in public places at any place .
Hie you to church .	Listen to you .
I must another way To fetch a ladder , by the which your love Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark .	I bet it's a little way to see the gods , by your love and a terrible rage , which it is as precious to wear .
Go .	Go .
I'll to dinner .	I'll
Hie you to the cell .	Listen to you to the pantry .
I do but keep the peace .	I do just keep the peace .
Put up thy sword , Or manage it to part these men with me .	Put up your sword , Or if it starts to part these men with me .
What , drawn , and talk of peace ?	What , wait , and talk about it ?
I hate the word , As I hate hell , all Montagues , and thee .	I hate the word , as I hate it , all hell , and I'm not dreaming .
Have at thee , coward !	Have at you , coward !
Clubs , bills , and partisans !	Conquer , crush , and wait !
Strike !	Strike !
Beat them down !	Don't go down !
Down with the Capulets !	Wake up with the wine !
Down with the Montagues !	Play the mixture !
What noise is this ?	What noise is this ?
My sword , I say !	My sword , I say !
Old Montague is come , And flourishes his blade in spite of me .	Gracious messenger is come , but his position is in its face .
Thou villain Capulet !	He's villain to say this !
Thou shalt not stir one foot to seek a foe .	He's not ready to buy a single room to get a present .
Hie to high fortune !	Listen to my fortune !
Honest Nurse , farewell .	Honest countrymen , farewell .
Amen , amen .	Amen , goodbye .
But come what sorrow can , It can not countervail the exchange of joy That one short minute gives me in her sight .	But come , though everything can happen to protect me , I'll get sure of the gods that one wronged hell in her .
Therefore love moderately .	Don't love me .
Long love doth so .	You don't love so .
Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow .	Too bad things as dirty as yourself as a moment .
Here comes the lady .	Here comes the lady .
Oh , so light a foot Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint .	Oh , so light a little day we'll wear the least that's making magic around .
Good even to my ghostly confessor .	Listen to my sister's going to sell up .
Romeo shall thank thee , daughter , for us both .	Meanwhile I'll thank you , for you , both of us .
As much to him , else is his thanks too much .	As much to him , it'll be fine too much .
Ah , Juliet , if the measure of thy joy Be heaped like mine , and that thy skill be more To blazon it , then sweeten with thy breath This neighbor air , and let rich music's tongue Unfold the imagined happiness that both Receive in either by this dear encounter .	Ah , sir , if the vows of your plea of yours .
Conceit , more rich in matter than in words , Brags of his substance , not of ornament .	You're a better in chains than in sense of words , not superficial beauty , of his bleeding .
Come , come with me , and we will make short work .	Come , come with me , and we will make short work .
I pray thee , good Mercutio , let's retire .	I don't want to know what you're going to do .
Thou art like one of those fellows that , when he enters the confines of a tavern , claps me his sword upon the table and says "God send me no need of thee ! " and , by the operation of the second cup , draws it on the drawer when indeed there is no need .	I'm sure he's one of those knights , when he summoned the height of a courtier , watch me a whip and says the music he wants to look like me !
Am I like such a fellow ?	Am I like a good fellow ?
Come , come , thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as any in Italy , and as soon moved to be moody , and as soon moody to be moved .	Come on , you're as smart as a saint in an unusually king as any man in Italy , and as soon to be free , and as soon as you're to be captured .
And what to ?	And what ?
Nay , an there were two such , we should have none shortly , for one would kill the other .	Yes , he's there two such luck , we should have something one for me , that would kill the other .
Thou , why , thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more or a hair less in his beard than thou hast .	I'm sure , you can get a man that a man and either more hair in a beard than his hair grows in a beard .
Thou wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts , having no other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes .	He's waiting with a man who kept away for many other , but I'm sure you're just making fun of him .
What eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel ?	What eye was an insult or such a disease as worthless ?
Thy head is as full of quarrels as an egg is full of meat , and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as an egg for quarreling .	Your head is as full of war as he is full of cost , and yet your head has been just as an eggshell and as leaky for an hour .
Thou hast quarreled with a man for coughing in the street because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun .	I've been competing for a man in the street for the duke that he has suffered a dog in the sky that he survived .
Didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing his new doublet before Easter ?	Didn't they fall out with a fool from his new soldiers before he's married ?
With another , for tying his new shoes with old ribbon ?	With another , for his new mistress's old man with you ?
And yet thou wilt tutor me from quarreling !	And yet I can get me from home !
An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art , any man should buy the fee simple of my life for an hour and a quarter .	When I were so smart to imagine you are as any man , the man should buy the price of my life for an hour and a quarter .
The fee simple ?	The devil's Rosalind ?
O simple !	Oh , unfaithful !
By my head , here comes the Capulets .	By my head , here comes the boxes .
By my heel , I care not .	By my habit , I don't care .
Couple it with something .	Pick it with something .
Make it a word and a blow .	Make it a word and a blow .
You shall find me apt enough to that , sir , an you will give me occasion .	You won't find me enough to Venice , that you can give me an answer to you .
Could you not take some occasion without giving ?	Could you expect some bodily party like that ?
Mercutio , thou consort'st with Romeo .	Meanwhile , I'm leaving with you .
What , dost thou make us minstrels ?	What , are you trying to make us weep ?
An thou make minstrels of us , look to hear nothing but discords .	An if you get out of us , just to look after nothing .
We talk here in the public haunt of men .	We talk here in the public affairs of men .
Either withdraw unto some private place , And reason coldly of your grievances , Or else depart .	Either immediately .
Here all eyes gaze on us .	Here all eyes tend on us .
Men's eyes were made to look and let them gaze .	Antony's eyes were made to look and let them tremble .
I will not budge for no man's pleasure , I .	I won't just take any man's second-hand goods .
Well , peace be with you , sir .	Well , peace be with you , sir .
Here comes my man .	Here comes my man .
But I'll be hanged , sir , if he wear your livery .	But I'll be able to swear if he were your proxy .
Tybalt , the reason that I have to love thee Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting .	Really , the reason that I don't need to love you to excuse the truth to suffer such a story .
Villain am I none .	You're right for me .
Therefore , farewell .	Don't talk to me .
I see thou know'st me not .	I see you're not fully out of you .
Boy , this shall not excuse the injuries That thou hast done me .	Boy , this doesn't excuse you to admit the rumors that have done .
Therefore turn and draw .	Don't turn out and listen .
And so , good Capulet , which name I tender As dearly as my own , be satisfied .	And so , good farmers , which I feel as tender as my own father , I'm satisfied .
O calm dishonourable , vile submission !	Oh , calm , vile , scoundrel !
What wouldst thou have with me ?	What does she have to tell me ?
Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher by the ears ?	Will you try your sword out of his ears ?
Make haste , lest mine be about your ears ere it be out .	Make yourself , lest I lose your best ears if it runs out .
I am for you .	I am for you .
Gentle Mercutio , put thy rapier up .	Meanwhile , let's put up your dagger on me .
Away , Tybalt .	Hurry , hurry .
I am hurt .	I want to hurt .
A plague o ' both your houses !	A plague on your bedroom !
I am sped .	I am
Is he gone and hath nothing ?	Is he right and has nothing ?
What , art thou hurt ?	What , you're not hurt ?
Marry , 'tis enough .	Yes , it's enough .
Where is my page ? , Go , villain , fetch a surgeon .	Where is my servant , Please , good-bye , get a liar !
Courage , man .	Hello , man .
The hurt can not be much .	The hurt can be just a stupid man .
No , 'tis not so deep as a well nor so wide as a church-door , but 'tis enough , 'twill serve .	No , it's not so deep as a dove as a whole world , but it's just a hurry , he'll punish .
Ask for me tomorrow , and you shall find me a grave man .	Ask me for tomorrow , and you shall find me a fool's cap .
I am peppered , I warrant , for this world .	I am indebted to you , I wish for this .
A plague o ' both your houses !	A plague on your bedroom !
Zounds , a dog , a rat , a mouse , a cat to scratch a man to death !	Hey , a dog , a penny , a plaything , a snail , a Jew to death !
A braggart , a rogue , a villain that fights by the book of arithmetic !	A drunkard , a handsome man that a villain owes the head of the book !
Why the devil came you between us ?	Why are the men waiting for you ?
I was hurt under your arm .	I was told your song .
I thought all for the best .	I thought all for the best .
Help me into some house , Benvolio , Or I shall faint .	Help me into some house , or I couldn't , it'll be .
A plague o ' both your houses !	A plague on your bedroom !
They have made worms ' meat of me .	They have made fun of me .
I have it , And soundly too .	I have it , and it'll be too .
Your houses !	Your bedroom !
O Romeo , Romeo , brave Mercutio is dead !	Oh , help , oh , brave man is dead !
Here comes the furious Tybalt back again .	Here comes the smartest working-man back again .
Alive in triumph , and Mercutio slain !	Companions in triumph , and hurry !
Either thou or I , or both , must go with him .	Either you or I , both , I'd go with him .
Thou , wretched boy , that didst consort him here Shalt with him hence .	He's a kind monster , that wouldn't bother him here with him .
This shall determine that .	This won't happen that .
Romeo , away , be gone !	Hey , away , be gone !
The citizens are up , and Tybalt slain .	The actors are up and threatening to clay .
Stand not amazed .	We're just alive .
The Prince will doom thee death If thou art taken .	The Prince will escape peacefully what you can get out of .
Hence , be gone , away !	You're a busy right , there !
Why dost thou stay ?	Why are you coming ?
Which way ran he that killed Mercutio ?	Which way he died that killed ?
Tybalt , that murderer , which way ran he ?	Yeah , that are you afraid that has abandoned around ?
There lies that Tybalt .	There lies that gown's for me .
Speak , nephew .	Speak , ma'am .
Were you by when it began ?	Were you when it's off ?
Where are the vile beginners of this fray ?	Where are the branches
O noble prince , I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl .	Oh , noble prince , I can discover all the rumors of this horrible hill .
There lies the man , slain by young Romeo , That slew thy kinsman , brave Mercutio .	There lies the man , Roderigo , by young : she's wounded , are too sad .
Tybalt , my cousin !	Listen , my cousin !
O my brother's child !	Oh , my brother's child !
O cousin , cousin !	Oh , cousin , cousin !
Benvolio , who began this bloody fray ?	Really , who are bloody this bloody battle ?
Romeo , he cries aloud , "Hold , friends !	Hurry , let's die immediately , do your friends !
Friends , part ! " and , swifter than his tongue , His agile arm beats down their fatal points , And 'twixt them rushes , underneath whose arm An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life Of stout Mercutio , and then Tybalt fled .	Friends , part !
But by and by comes back to Romeo , Who had but newly entertained revenge , And to 't they go like lightning , for ere I Could draw to part them was stout Tybalt slain .	But that's as back by pleading and crying , but to send reinforcements to move home , and they have to sleep after them , while I was carried to them part about them into dead .
And , as he fell , did Romeo turn and fly .	And , as he fell , will turn and fly away .
This is the truth , or let Benvolio die .	This is the way , unless I let its sleep .
He speaks not true .	He speaks about it .
Some twenty of them fought in this black strife , And all those twenty could but kill one life .	Some of them fought like this couple in the main wind , and that's all those while I could kill one .
I beg for justice , which thou , Prince , must give .	I beg for justice , which , you must give revenge .
Romeo slew Tybalt .	Separate them .
Romeo must not live .	Listen to me soon .
Romeo slew him ; he slew Mercutio .	Arrest him : he agrees , I'll fight .
Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe ?	Who now , the noble duke holds it even some ?
His fault concludes but what the law should end , The life of Tybalt .	His courage just like the law , which only happens to me than the life of the moon .
I have an interest in your hearts ' proceeding .	I have an throats in your hearts ' welfare .
But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine That you shall all repent the loss of mine .	But I'll linger you with so strong a little way to deliver the people of loss for mine .
I will be deaf to pleading and excuses .	I won't be mild to me anymore .
Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses , Therefore use none .	Just remember I've given him out , I'll use you to drink out .
Bear hence this body and attend our will .	She's sleeping here and receive this great battle .
Mercy but murders , pardoning those that kill .	Other women have to kill those who kill you .
Lovers can see to do their amorous rites By their own beauties , or , if love be blind , It best agrees with night .	Please do .
Come , civil night , Thou sober-suited matron , all in black , And learn me how to lose a winning match Played for a pair of stainless maidenhoods .	Come on , "nothing" are playing you in , it's all a pain in death , and teach me to a soul drown a man for full of a position .
Hood my unmanned blood bating in my cheeks , With thy black mantle , till strange love , grow bold , Think true love acted simple modesty .	Meanwhile , my companions !
Come , night .	Come on , gentlemen .
Come , Romeo .	Come on , shovel .
Come , thou day in night , For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night Whiter than new snow upon a raven's back .	Come on , watch them in the morning , while you're staying on the night of war than a new sultan puts on a thousand .
And when I shall die , Take him and cut him out in little stars , And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night And pay no worship to the garish sun .	And when I didn't die , I'll cut him out and cut him in the rest , and he will make the face of heaven so far all the world will be in love with him walk and no personal ambition to be loud .
The cords That Romeo bid thee fetch ?	The "passionate" body who wants to get king's ?
Ay , ay , the cords .	Yes , ma'am , the jeweler .
Ay me , what news ?	Yes , what are you done ?
Why dost thou wring thy hands ?	Why are you chewing to your hands like you ?
Ah , welladay !	Ah , oh !
We are undone , lady , we are undone !	We are tired , lady , we are undone !
Alack the day !	Damn the day !
Can heaven be so envious ?	Can God be so crazy ?
Romeo can , Though heaven can not .	Meanwhile , can what I can .
What devil art thou that dost torment me thus ?	What are you doing that you've seen me wrong ?
This torture should be roared in dismal hell .	This opinion should be seeing in heaven again .
Hath Romeo slain himself ?	Has attention to Rome ?
Say thou but "ay , " And that bare vowel Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice .	Say you're talking about how much he deserves to be chaste around and fragrant him .
I am not I if there be such an Or those eyes shut that makes thee answer "ay." If he be slain , say "ay , " or if not , "no." Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe .	I'm going to be there .
To prison , eyes , ne'er look on liberty .	To prison , just , crack only one on it .
Vile earth , to earth resign .	Everyone kiss me , to earth .
O Tybalt , Tybalt , the best friend I had !	Oh , hello , the best thing I had !
That ever I should live to see thee dead .	That ever I should live to see you like something .
Is Romeo slaughtered , and is Tybalt dead ?	Is Marcus Luccicos , and is my father dead ?
My dearest cousin and my dearer lord ?	My dearest relative , my sweet lord ?
Tybalt is gone , and Romeo banished .	Everything is right , and unfair good .
O God , did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood ?	Oh God , did he turn hand on blood ?
It did , it did .	It did , it did .
Alas the day , it did .	Alas the day , it did .
O serpent heart hid with a flowering face !	Oh , Caesar screamed with a face !
Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave ?	Did I ever keep a little beautiful husband ?
Dove-feathered raven , wolvish-ravening lamb !	Silly babbler , how dare you !
O nature , what hadst thou to do in hell When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend In moral paradise of such sweet flesh ?	Oh , why have a little match to do that if you could find the ghost of a word who's late over with such sweet flesh ?
Was ever book containing such vile matter So fairly bound ?	Isn't this messenger in Denmark so long ?
Ah , where's my man ? , Give me some aqua vitae. , These griefs , these woes , these sorrows make me old .	Ah , where's my wife ?
Shame come to Romeo !	Shame over to the jail !
Blistered be thy tongue For such a wish !	You're not worth an animal like a wish !
He was not born to shame .	He was born to shame anymore .
Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit , For 'tis a throne where honor may be crowned .	On his position !
Sole monarch of the universal earth , Oh , what a beast was I to chide at him !	Everything of righteousness , the royal gods , what a man was I compelled to was at him !
Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin ?	Will you speak well about him that your friend ?
But wherefore , villain , didst thou kill my cousin ?	But why , Nature , don't you kill my cousin ?
That villain cousin would have killed my husband .	That villain doesn't love my enemy would have my husband .
All this is comfort .	All this is good .
Wherefore weep I then ?	What's going on , then ?
I would forget it fain , But oh , it presses to my memory , Like damned guilty deeds to sinners ' minds .	I wish you didn't kill those murderous sins , it is to my country , to choose guilty of this hateful services .
Tybalt is dead , and Romeo banished."	Everything is dead , and it's dead !
That "banished , " that one word "banished" Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts .	That happens , that word one word has already landed out of a cold adult .
Tybalt's death Was woe enough , if it had ended there .	Actually , death meant enough , if it had only finished .
Or , if sour woe delights in fellowship And needly will be ranked with other griefs , Why followed not , when she said "Tybalt's dead , " "Thy father" or "thy mother , " nay , or both , Which modern lamentations might have moved ?	Or , if
But with a rearward following Tybalt's death , "Romeo is banished." To speak that word , Is father , mother , Tybalt , Romeo , Juliet , All slain , all dead .	But with a series of death , you'll come to death , speak that word , father , mother , mother , oh , oh , All , all dead .
Romeo is banished." There is no end , no limit , measure , bound , In that word's death .	Really , it's daytime , which is no bottom , no limit , more than that , under death .
No words can that woe sound .	No words can tempt that horrible shouting over .
Where is my father and my mother , Nurse ?	Where is my father and my mother , Touchstone ?
Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse .	Tonight and take out of combat .
Will you go to them ?	Will you go to them ?
I will bring you thither .	I won't bring you room .
Wash they his wounds with tears ?	Aren't they his eyes with brawling knights ?
Mine shall be spent When theirs are dry , for Romeo's banishment .	Meanwhile , I'll die until I've begun her own attention to her tasks .
Take up those cords. , Poor ropes , you are beguiled , Both you and I , for Romeo is exiled .	Take up , those wrangling pirates , you are loyal , and you are responsible for you , it's full of money .
He made you for a highway to my bed , But I , a maid , die maiden-widowed .	He made you for a new sinner to marry , my father , a grieving , she'll die a peaceful .
And death , not Romeo , take my maidenhead !	And death , don't be ashamed , my master's queen !
Hie to your chamber .	Listen to your tomb .
I'll find Romeo To comfort you .	I'll find everything to comfort you .
I wot well where he is .	I admit you right where he is .
Hark ye , your Romeo will be here at night .	Listen to your tardy , be here at night .
I'll to him .	I'll
He is hid at Lawrence ' cell .	He is at five places to me .
Romeo , come forth .	Hurry , hurry up .
Come forth , thou fearful man .	Come on , you're one man .
Father , what news ?	Father , what news ?
Too familiar Is my dear son with such sour company .	Too amazing is my dear son with such violent respect .
I bring thee tidings of the Prince's doom .	I bring you proof of the dialogue .
What less than doomsday is the Prince's doom ?	What less than anyone is the savage snake ?
Ha , banishment !	Ha , ha !
Be merciful , say "death , " For exile hath more terror in his look , Much more than death .	I'm bleeding , one , or more : I've thanked you more in its talk , he's more than death .
Do not say "banishment." Hence from Verona art thou banished .	Don't say anything from Desdemona is not wrinkled around .
Be patient , for the world is broad and wide .	Be patient , for the world is wide and ladylike .
There is no world without Verona walls But purgatory , torture , hell itself .	There is no danger they're leaving behind their barks , where God drops itself for hell .
Hence "banished" is banished from the world , And world's exile is death .	You're going to catch from the world , because I'm starting to realize I'm dead .
Calling death "banishment , " Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden ax And smilest upon the stroke that murders me .	Everything !
O deadly sin !	Oh , unfaithful !
O rude unthankfulness !	Oh , happy !
Tis torture and not mercy .	It's almost appropriate and money .
More validity , More honorable state , more courtship lives In carrion flies than Romeo .	More , Demetrius , more honorable than you have been washed than its stones for a monkey .
Flies may do this , but I from this must fly .	Everything may do this , but I must take this fly .
They are free men , but I am banished .	They are free people , but I am unfaithful .
And sayst thou yet that exile is not death ?	And don't you know that I'm saying about the death ?
Hadst thou no poison mixed , no sharp-ground knife , No sudden mean of death , though ne'er so mean , But "banished" to kill me ? , "Banished" !	Really , I'm not sad , gentlemen , though they had no harm to do so kind , even though they could say to kill me , don't wish ?
O Friar , the damned use that word in hell .	Oh , Friar , the real one that kept me in .
Howling attends it .	Everything about it .
How hast thou the heart , Being a divine , a ghostly confessor , A sin-absolver , and my friend professed , To mangle me with that word "banished" ?	How are you ?
Thou fond mad man , hear me a little speak .	He's crazy about me , however a little bit .
Here were the servants of your adversary , And yours , close fighting ere I did approach .	Here were the servants of your servants , and then die seriously less than I did .
I drew to part them .	I repeat to both you .
While we were interchanging thrusts and blows , Came more and more and fought on part and part , Till the Prince came , who parted either part .	While we were dazed and blows , six more and handsome night and end , and part by the Prince , who came married , either because of Cupid is .
Oh , where is Romeo ?	Oh , where is that ?
Saw you him today ?	Don't you see him today ?
Right glad I am he was not at this fray .	Right about what I was talking about this at him .
Towards him I made , but he was 'ware of me And stole into the covert of the wood .	Sometimes I made him , but he was because of me who was barely cut out of the wood .
Many a morning hath he there been seen , With tears augmenting the fresh morning's dew , Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs .	Many a minute he has already been passed , but with all the fiery marble , we'd been punished to suck less up with his red clothes .
But all so soon as the all-cheering sun Should in the farthest east begin to draw The shady curtains from Aurora's bed , Away from light steals home my heavy son ,	But all so soon as the sun can see the living daylights off to the theaters from five Tom that will come from light , cold , light from my finger , my lord !
Oh , thou wilt speak again of banishment .	Oh , I'm going to speak again by killing yourself .
Talk no more .	Talk no more .
Oh , then I see that madmen have no ears .	Oh , then I see that gentlemen to have no ears .
How should they , when that wise men have no eyes ?	How should we do when that wise men have been so equal ?
Let me dispute with thee of thy estate .	Let me tell you of your situation .
Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel .	I'm telling you that I'm not guilty of you .
Wert thou as young as I , Juliet thy love , An hour but married , Tybalt murdered , Doting like me , and like me banished , Then mightst thou speak , then mightst thou tear thy hair And fall upon the ground , as I do now , Taking the measure of an unmade grave .	Really , I guess .
Arise .	Certainly .
One knocks .	You're naughty .
Good Romeo , hide thyself .	Good idea , let's hide .
Not I , unless the breath of heartsick groans , Mistlike , infold me from the search of eyes .	Wait , I saw the only one of war , serve me , kick me from the search of eyes .
Who knocks so hard ?	Who doesn't appear so ?
Whence come you ?	Aren't you coming ?
What's your will ?	What's your will ?
O holy Friar , O , tell me , holy Friar , Where is my lady's lord ?	Oh , oh , oh , oh , oh , how silly is my nephew ?
Where's Romeo ?	Where's Seleucus ?
Oh , he is even in my mistress ' case , Just in her case .	Oh , he is even in my English ' case , except in her case .
O woeful sympathy , Piteous predicament !	Oh , it's busy , oh !
Even so lies she , Blubbering and weeping , weeping and blubbering .	Even so lies she , and shout , weeping and weeping .
Stand , an you be a man .	Good-bye , you can be a man .
For Juliet's sake , for her sake , rise and stand .	For Falstaff , for her sake , don't stand up and stand .
Why should you fall into so deep an O ?	Why should you fall into so deep a sin ?
Nurse !	Damn it !
Ah sir , ah sir .	Ah sir , sir .
Death's the end of all .	Companions .
Spakest thou of Juliet ?	Aren't you out of here ?
How is it with her ?	How is it with her ?
Where is she ?	Where is she ?
And how doth she ?	And how did she get ?
And what says My concealed lady to our canceled love ?	And what does it square to our own love ?
As if that name , Shot from the deadly level of a gun , Did murder her , as that name's cursed hand Murdered her kinsman .	As if that name , it's the deadly animal with a shrew of dirtied murder , that she could repay her that cursed hand her kinsman .
O , tell me , Friar , tell me , In what vile part of this anatomy Doth my name lodge ?	Oh , tell me , tell me , oh , tell me how many of this terrible grave is now ?
Tell me , that I may sack The hateful mansion .	Tell me , that I may undo this hateful way .
Art thou a man ?	You're a man ?
Thy wild acts denote The unreasonable fury of a beast .	Your wild expression out of Athens .
Thou hast amazed me .	I've been taught you .
By my holy order , I thought thy disposition better tempered .	By my bad moment , I thought your disposition better equally .
Hast thou slain Tybalt ?	Has he come offended ?
Why rail'st thou on thy birth , the heaven , and earth ?	Why are you chewing on your own life , the earth , and earth ?
Fie , fie , thou shamest thy shape , thy love , thy wit , Which , like a usurer , abound'st in all And usest none in that true use indeed Which should bedeck thy shape , thy love , thy wit .	Stop , hurry , your highness , even though your wit , your highness , like a real story , which was like a real friend in all that doesn't hope since it's true , your goodness can do , your love .
What , rouse thee , man !	What , don't wish me like that !
Thy Juliet is alive , For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead , There art thou happy .	Your highness is alive , or it's true for you , but how far it is , and you're happy .
Tybalt would kill thee , But thou slew'st Tybalt , there art thou happy .	Everything would marry , you're lying , " you're there , you're going to die .
The law that threatened death becomes thy friend And turns it to exile , there art thou happy .	The law that ugly times now is an excellent man and break it to be there , you stupid .
A pack of blessings light upon thy back , Happiness courts thee in her best array ,	A tiny spot of comfort lies up in your hellish heart. , Trumpets , her pearl in the devil's trap .
But , like a misbehaved and sullen wench , Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love .	But , like a moment and sullen recognizes a row , excepting meal times and your love .
Go , get thee to thy love , as was decreed .	Go , get you to your love , as was as tireless .
Ascend her chamber , hence , and comfort her .	Ask her apart , and wait , and comfort her .
Commend me to thy lady , And bid her hasten all the house to bed , Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto .	Good-bye , someone else , and you'll let her go to the house , which killed going to make them rich enough .
Romeo is coming .	Everything is coming .
O Lord , I could have stayed here all the night To hear good counsel .	Oh , Lord , I could have sent all the night to hear about good advice .
Oh , what learning is !	Oh , what stuff !
Do so , and bid my sweet prepare to chide .	Do so , and tell me to finish my advice .
Here , sir , a ring she bid me give you , sir .	Here , sir , a ring she gave me , please you .
Hie you , make haste , for it grows very late .	Listen to you , make yourself for it is very late .
How well my comfort is revived by this !	How well my job is by doing this !
Go hence .	Go ahead .
Good night .	Good night .
And here stands all your state : Either be gone before the watch be set , Or by the break of day disguised from hence .	And here goes all your state when you're gone , if the rest drop on the island , or break by the game of hell .
Sojourn in Mantua .	Companions in eight .
I'll find out your man , And he shall signify from time to time Every good hap to you that chances here .	I'll find out your man , and he won't agree to time from time to good morning to you that point here .
Give me thy hand .	Give me your hand .
Tis late .	It's late .
Farewell .	Farewell .
Things have fall'n out , sir , so unluckily , That we have had no time to move our daughter .	They're all welcome , sir , so we have to say that we had no time to move our daughter .
Look you , she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly , And so did I .	Look , you loved her father , she was dead , because I did .
Well , we were born to die .	Well , we were born to die .
These times of woe afford no time to woo .	These noblemen of share that no time to help you .
Madam , good night .	Madam , good night .
Commend me to your daughter .	Take me to your daughter .
I will , and know her mind early tomorrow .	I will , and know her mind early tomorrow .
Tonight she is mewed up to her heaviness .	Tonight she is perfectly up to her own indiscretions .
Sir Paris , I will make a desperate tender Of my child's love .	Sir , I will make a desperate guide you than my sweet love .
Acquaint her here of my son Paris ' love , And bid her , mark you me , on Wednesday next , But , soft !	Instead of her here !
What day is this ?	What day is this ?
Monday , my lord .	Good-bye , my lord .
Monday !	Let's go !
Ha , ha .	Ha , ha .
Do you like this haste ?	Do you like this play ?
We'll keep no great ado , a friend or two .	We'll keep no great hit , a friend or two .
For , hark you , Tybalt being slain so late , It may be thought we held him carelessly , Being our kinsman , if we revel much .	Terrible , good-bye , you don't think so much , we may be thought we followed him , it's our advantage , if we die , if we stayed .
Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends , And there an end .	Don't try to find some big talk , and he's still a end .
But what say you to Thursday ?	But what do you say to tempt me ?
My lord , I would that Thursday were tomorrow .	My lord , I would that were ready or tomorrow .
Well get you gone .	Well get you gone .
O ' Thursday be it , then. , Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed .	Oh , it's not it , you think , Go to you , give me to bed .
Wilt thou be gone ?	Didn't you be gone ?
It is not yet near day .	It doesn't matter about things to sleep .
It was the nightingale , and not the lark , That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear .	It was the job , and not the executioner's axe , who sounds like the stinking air .
Look , love , what envious streaks Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east .	Look , love , what happens about the world that the phoenix ' infected sheep .
Night's candles are burnt out , and jocund day Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops .	Snip !
Yon light is not daylight , I know it , I .	Everything about how I don't know it , I know it .
It is some meteor that the sun exhales To be to thee this night a torchbearer , And light thee on thy way to Mantua .	It is some important business that you were supposed to be a chance to get this night , and light on you to put your way to me .
Therefore stay yet .	Don't stay yet .
Thou need'st not to be gone .	I'm afraid to be a moving .
Let me be ta'en .	Let me be cheerful .
Let me be put to death .	Let me be off to death .
I am content , so thou wilt have it so .	I want to listen to tell you how much I have .
I have more care to stay than will to go .	I have more care to stay than to go .
Come , death , and welcome !	Come on , death and welcome !
Let's talk .	Let's go .
It is not day .	It is not day .
It is , it is .	It is , it is .
It is the lark that sings so out of tune , Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps .	It is the lark that so loud , out of tune , so debauched and healthy .
Some say the lark makes sweet division .	Some problem is the lark from my own children .
This doth not so , for she divideth us .	This doesn't matter so , for she knows us .
More light and light it grows .	More light and light it is .
More light and light , more dark and dark our woes !	More light and light , more dark and nasty !
Madam .	Madam .
Nurse ?	Understand ?
Your lady mother is coming to your chamber .	Your lady is coming to your uncle's house .
The day is broke .	The day is approaching .
Then , window , let day in and let life out .	Then , Hercules , and let heaven let me drop out .
Farewell , farewell .	Farewell , farewell .
One kiss , and I'll descend .	You're making me like a hurry .
And private in his chamber pens himself , Shuts up his windows , locks fair daylight out , And makes himself an artificial night .	And private in his chamber army , creeping like a tree , groaning feasts , corpses lands and sees a ship an important night .
My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?	My noble uncle , do you know the cause ?
I neither know it nor can learn of him .	I neither know it nor can be like to ask him .
Have you importuned him by any means ?	Have you seen him by any means ?
I would thou wert so happy by thy stay To hear true shrift. , Come , madam , let's away .	I would keep you up so happy by crying to hear your cousin , madam , let's go away .
Art thou gone so , love , lord ?	You're a husband , love you , love ?
Oh , by this count I shall be much in years Ere I again behold my Romeo .	Oh , by this paper I can be much in chains than I swear again .
Farewell !	Farewell !
I will omit no opportunity That may convey my greetings , love , to thee .	I won't take anything except my father , then , I'll help you to kill you .
Oh , think'st thou we shall ever meet again ?	Oh , what's going to get there again ?
O God , I have an ill-divining soul .	Oh God , I have an incomparable girl .
Methinks I see thee now , thou art so low As one dead in the bottom of a tomb .	Maybe I see you now , you're so silly as one woman in the sun of a book .
Either my eyesight fails , or thou look'st pale .	Either my nephew doing , or you look pale .
And trust me , love , in my eye so do you .	And don't trust me , love in my love do so you .
Dry sorrow drinks our blood .	Everything about yours .
Adieu , adieu !	Goodbye , goodbye !
O fortune , fortune !	Oh , fortune , fortune !
All men call thee fickle .	All men call you seriously .
Be fickle , fortune , For then , I hope , thou wilt not keep him long , But send him back .	Be calm , then , or I'll hope , then I can keep him long , even though he's brought him back .
Who is 't that calls ?	Who is that that ?
Is it my lady mother ?	Is it my mother ?
What unaccustomed cause procures her hither ?	What does Northumberland want to eat her ?
Why , how now , Juliet ?	Why , how did you say that ?
Madam , I am not well .	Madam , I don't know you .
Evermore weeping for your cousin's death ?	Drawing your weeping for your entire death ?
What , wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears ?	What , will you accompany him from his grave with tears ?
An if thou couldst , thou couldst not make him live .	If if you're here , you can make him crazy else .
Therefore , have done .	Don't have to work .
Some grief shows much of love , But much of grief shows still some want of wit .	Some criminal shows chattering of love , even though one of grief has always been taken care of .
Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss .	Either let me weep for such a bit longer .
So shall you feel the loss , but not the friend Which you weep for .	So you'll feel the loss , but not the value you who died for you .
Feeling so the loss , Can not choose but ever weep the friend .	Right so the loss is the crime , but you'll keep anything the same .
Well , girl , thou weep'st not so much for his death , As that the villain lives which slaughtered him .	Well , girl , you're not so much for his death , as that the villain has lives through the battlefield .
What villain , madam ?	What villain , madam ?
That same villain , Romeo .	That same villain , please .
That is because the traitor murderer lives .	That is because the traitor himself lives .
Ay , madam , from the reach of these my hands .	Yes , madam , from the roof of these battles .
Would none but I might venge my cousin's death !	Would only I just until my head is just death !
Then weep no more .	Then please keep any more .
I'll send to one in Mantua , Where that same banished runagate doth live , Shall give him such an unaccustomed dram That he shall soon keep Tybalt company .	I'll send to one in fact , that Cassio means that you're smart , you'll give him an oyster at its army that he won't keep back without company .
And then , I hope , thou wilt be satisfied .	And then , I hope you're going to be satisfied .
Indeed , I never shall be satisfied With Romeo , till I behold him , dead , Is my poor heart for a kinsman vexed .	Indeed , I won't never be satisfied until I saw him , oh , my poor heart , for my poor heart for a worthless night .
Madam , if you could find out but a man To bear a poison , I would temper it , That Romeo should , upon receipt thereof , Soon sleep in quiet .	Madam , if you could find out a man like a man , I would dare swear to be that point , I should recognize them , look in trouble .
To wreak the love I bore my cousin Upon his body that slaughtered him !	To escape the love I hate my cousin on his body that he frowns !
Find thou the means , and I'll find such a man .	Find the worst right , and I'll find such a man .
But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings , girl .	But now I'll tell you privately , restrain yourself .
And joy comes well in such a needy time .	And joy are well in such a time .
What are they , beseech your ladyship ?	What are they doing , your highness ?
Well , well , thou hast a careful father , child .	Well , well , you're a careful father , child .
Madam , in happy time , what day is that ?	Madam , in happy time , what day is that ?
Marry , my child , early next Thursday morn , The gallant , young , and noble gentleman , The County Paris , at Saint Peter's Church , Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride .	Yes , yes .
Now , by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too , He shall not make me there a joyful bride .	Now , by Saint George , and it's too certain , he doesn't make me a box on this mission .
I wonder at this haste , that I must wed Ere he , that should be husband , comes to woo .	I wonder at this , that I must tell you , he should be that , if you're coming to kill me .
I pray you , tell my lord and father , madam , I will not marry yet .	I don't know what you want to know and father , my lord , I can't marry her. .
And when I do , I swear It shall be Romeo , whom you know I hate , Rather than Paris .	And when I do , I swear to be afraid , whom you know , I hate you , rather .
These are news indeed !	These are bad news !
Here comes your father .	Here comes your father .
Tell him so yourself , And see how he will take it at your hands .	Tell him so yourself , and see how he will take it at your hands .
How now ?	How did you say ?
A conduit , girl ?	A nice , tailor ?
What , still in tears , Evermore showering ?	What , still in war , what's going on ?
Have you delivered to her our decree ?	Have you forgotten our eye to her ?
I would the fool were married to her grave !	I would the fool were married to her grave !
How , will she none ?	How will she get one ?
Is she not proud ?	Is she really being angry ?
Doth she not count her blessed , Unworthy as she is , that we have wrought So worthy a gentleman to be her bride ?	Doesn't she marry her , it's sure she is , as she is that we have seen a gentleman to be her own servant ?
Not proud you have , but thankful that you have .	Not you proud , but I've decided that you have .
How , how , how , how ?	How are you , how , how ?
Chopped logic !	Halt !
What is this ?	What is this ?
Proud , " and "I thank you , " and "I thank you not , " And yet "not proud" ?	Damn you , " and I thank you , " and you didn't ask you whether anything was "Knock ?
Out , you green sickness , carrion !	Get up , you measly , lying candle !
Out , you baggage !	Get out , you dark-skinned gypsy !
You tallow face !	You kill me !
Fie , fie !	Stop , oh !
What , are you mad ?	What , are you crazy ?
Good Father , I beseech you on my knees , Hear me with patience but to speak a word .	Good Father , I beg you on my hand , Please tell me to speak but with a word .
Speak not .	We're not waiting for a single man .
Reply not .	Definitely not .
Do not answer me .	Don't answer me .
Out on her , hilding !	Get out , here !
God in heaven bless her !	God in heaven bless her !
You are to blame , my lord , to rate her so .	You are to blame , my lord , to blame her so .
And why , my Lady Wisdom ?	And why , my Lady Grey ?
Smatter with your gossips , go .	You're with your master , goodbye .
I speak no treason .	I speak no treason .
Oh , God 'i ' good e'en .	Oh , God bless good news with you .
May not one speak ?	May only one speak ?
Peace , you mumbling fool !	Quiet , you stupid fool !
Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl , For here we need it not .	Meanwhile , we're all inside and bite a little while we need it .
You are too hot .	You are too hot .
God's bread !	God's bedroom !
It makes me mad .	It makes me crazy .
Day , night , hour , tide , time , work , play , Alone , in company , still my care hath been To have her matched .	Everyone , watch , faster , before , work , night , Iras , and talk , you still have my plans to have her own equally .
Thursday is near .	Everything is near .
Lay hand on heart , advise .	Lay away in order , please .
An you be mine , I'll give you to my friend .	An you be mine , I'll give you to my friend .
Trust to 't , bethink you .	Listen to that , you half-blood .
I'll not be forsworn .	I'll be completely up .
Delay this marriage for a month , a week .	Thank this marriage for a month , a week .
Or , if you do not , make the bridal bed In that dim monument where Tybalt lies .	Or , if you want to do the king's bed , and it's clear that size of Bassanio .
Talk not to me , for I'll not speak a word .	Talk not to me , for I'll speak a word .
Do as thou wilt , for I have done with thee .	Do as I can , for I have done with you .
O God ! , O Nurse , how shall this be prevented ?	Oh God !
My husband is on earth , my faith in heaven .	My husband is on earth , my sword in heaven .
How shall that faith return again to earth , Unless that husband send it me from heaven By leaving earth ?	How will that happen immediately to France while that , even if God send it from me by heaven ?
Comfort me .	They're coming .
Hast thou not a word of joy ?	Has he been a word of joy ?
Some comfort , Nurse .	Some point , please .
Oh , he's a lovely gentleman .	Oh , he's a poor gentleman .
Romeo's a dishclout to him .	Sounds a lot to him .
An eagle , madam , Hath not so green , so quick , so fair an eye As Paris hath .	Fast !
Beshrew my very heart , I think you are happy in this second match , For it excels your first .	Thinking , my dear lord , I think you are happy in this second it , or paid your real son .
Or if it did not , Your first is dead , or 'twere as good he were , As living here and you no use of him .	Or if it doesn't say that , your highness is dead or worse , as if he were , and something you can keep him out of you .
Speakest thou from thy heart ?	Aren't you from your heart ?
Amen !	Amen !
What ?	What ?
Well , thou hast comforted me marvelous much .	Well , you've been frowning very much to me .
Go in , and tell my lady I am gone , Having displeased my father , to Lawrence's cell To make confession and to be absolved .	Go in , and tell my lady I am going to stop married , my father , to accept my farm to make fun of and listen to .
Marry , I will , and this is wisely done .	Yes , I will , and this is wisely .
O most wicked fiend !	Oh , how wicked !
I'll to the friar to know his remedy .	I'll get to the message to his advice .
If all else fail , myself have power to die .	If all else happens , I have power to die .
On Thursday , sir ?	On what you did , sir ?
The time is very short .	The time is very valuable .
You say you do not know the lady's mind .	You say you don't know the whole way now .
I like it not .	I like it completely .
Now do you know the reason of this haste .	Now do you know the reason of this forest .
Look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .	Look , sir , here comes the lady toward my cell .
Happily met , my lady and my wife .	Well yes , my lady and my wife .
That may be , sir , when I may be a wife .	That may be , sir , when I won't be a wife .
Good morrow , cousin .	Good luck , cousin .
Is the day so young ?	Is the day so young ?
But new struck nine .	But new effort .
Was that my father that went hence so fast ?	Was that my father that went down so fast ?
It was .	It was .
Not having that which , having , makes them short .	Not that makes that , having least them make fun .
In love ?	In love ?
Out .	Get out .
Of love ?	Of love ?
Where shall we dine ? , O me !	Where shall we get married , sir ?
That "may be" must be , love , on Thursday next .	That counts short must be , love , on next ceremony .
What must be shall be .	What must be to be afraid .
That's a certain text .	That's a certain attitude .
Come you to make confession to this Father ?	Come you to make fun of this contract ?
To answer that , I should confess to you .	I'd answer that , I should also to you .
Do not deny to him that you love me .	Don't worry about him that you want to love me .
I will confess to you that I love him .	I won't pretend to you that I love him .
So will ye , I am sure , that you love me .	So please , I am sure , that you love me .
If I do so , it will be of more price Being spoke behind your back than to your face .	If I do so , it will be more prepared from masks than your highness ' way to your face .
Poor soul , thy face is much abused with tears .	Poor soul , your face is much with tears with weeping .
Thy face is mine , and thou hast slandered it .	Your face is mine , and I'm not dreaming .
My leisure serves me , pensive daughter , now. , My lord , we must entreat the time alone .	My God saw me , you want to celebrate , maybe , my lord , we can't read the time .
God shield I should disturb devotion ! , Juliet , on Thursday early will I rouse ye .	God pardon me !
O Juliet , I already know thy grief .	Oh , I didn't know your grief .
I hear thou must , and nothing may prorogue it , On Thursday next be married to this county .	I hear you , and it's nothing to see it , or next next it goes to be next with this .
Tell me not , Friar , that thou hear'st of this , Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it .	Tell me , everyone , that you're lying , and this doesn't know that if you tell me how I didn't love you .
If in thy wisdom thou canst give no help , Do thou but call my resolution wise , And with this knife I'll help it presently .	If your highness has one help you can get no help , don't give you my kind friend , and I'll get this monster before it .
Hold , then .	Listen to me .
Wednesday is tomorrow .	Barnardo's over this morning .
Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone .	You look there are you dead here .
Let not the Nurse lie with thee in thy chamber .	Let me stay with the devil back in your bedroom .
No warmth , no breath shall testify thou livest .	No problem , no doubt I've got it back to you .
Give me , give me !	Let's give me a help !
Love give me strength , and strength shall help afford .	Love give me light , and strength to help us .
Farewell , dear Father .	Farewell , dear lady .
You shall have none ill , sir , for I'll try if they can lick their fingers .	You don't have any luck , sir , if I'll try to get whatever they can .
How canst thou try them so ?	How can I think you don't ?
Therefore he that can not lick his fingers goes not with me .	Don't say that he's carried away his position with me .
Go , be gone .	Go , hurry .
We shall be much unfurnished for this time .	We want to be much for this time .
Ay , forsooth .	Yes , yes .
See where she comes from shrift with merry look .	See where she comes from leaving with Mistress Shore .
Where I have learned me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition To you and your behests , and am enjoined By holy Lawrence to fall prostrate here To beg your pardon .	Today , I'm going to lend you to decide that the real son and your warrior heart , and I'm sure to live by whatever one I'll refuse to beg your pardon .
Send for the county .	Send for the appropriate time .
Go tell him of this .	Go tell him about this .
I'll have this knot knit up tomorrow morning .	I'll have this magic navy tomorrow morning will rush .
I met the youthful lord at Lawrence ' cell , And gave him what becomed love I might , Not stepping o'er the bounds of modesty .	I swear to the fact at the marketplace , but I've told him what I love , but wouldn't capture me from the stamp of a grandmother .
Why , I am glad on 't .	Why , I'm glad on the way .
This is well .	This is healthy .
Stand up .	Stand up .
Ay , marry , go , I say , and fetch him hither. , Now , afore God , this reverend holy friar !	Yes , please , go ahead , and say I won't get him , and , please God , this noble blood !
Our whole city is much bound to him .	Our whole person is much to pay him .
Nurse , will you go with me into my closet To help me sort such needful ornaments As you think fit to furnish me tomorrow ?	Niece , will you go with me to help me to watch my cave instead of answering you , as you ordered me to steal tomorrow ?
No , not till Thursday .	No , not till it's not .
There is time enough .	There is time enough .
We'll to church tomorrow .	We'll go to supper tomorrow .
Tis now near night .	It's just near night .
Tush , I will stir about , And all things shall be well , I warrant thee , wife .	Wait , I will die about all this , because I won't be well , I promise you , wife .
Go thou to Juliet , help to deck up her .	Go to you , help me to stand up .

Let me alone .	Let me alone .
I'll play the housewife for this once .	I'll play the appropriate for this once .
Ay , those attires are best .	Yes , those are difficult best .
What , are you busy , ho ?	What , are you getting up , mister ?
Need you my help ?	Aren't you my fool ?
For , I am sure , you have your hands full all In this so sudden business .	For , I am sure you have your hands all your sides have been so resolved on this business .
Good night .	Good night .
Farewell ! , God knows when we shall meet again .	Farewell , God knows when we meet again to meet .
My dismal scene I needs must act alone .	My thanes , Athens must not live until I act alone .
Come , vial .	Come on , shovel .
What if this mixture do not work at all ?	What if this happen does it do at all ?
Shall I be married then tomorrow morning ?	Shall I be married tomorrow tomorrow morning ?
Lie thou there .	You're lying there .
Oh , look !	Oh , look !
Methinks I see my cousin's ghost Seeking out Romeo , that did spit his body Upon a rapier's point .	Anyway , I see my bad messenger out that did laugh out his body , or if he runs out his messenger .
Stay , Tybalt , stay !	Stay , listen , stay !
Romeo , Romeo , Romeo !	Hurry , crush , go !
Here's drink .	Here's another .
I drink to thee .	I drink to you .
No , coz , I rather weep .	No , please , I don't bite myself .
Good heart , at what ?	Good heart , what did you think ?
Why , such is love's transgression .	Why , it's such nice .
What is it else ?	What is it else ?
A madness most discreet , A choking gall , and a preserving sweet .	A snake is a fickle son , a tumor digesting a bloodline .
Farewell , my coz .	Farewell , my dear lord .
Soft !	Hello !
I will go along .	I won't go inside .
And if you leave me so , you do me wrong .	And if you leave me so , you do me wrong .
Tut , I have lost myself .	Tut , I have lost myself .
I am not here .	I don't like that .
Tell me in sadness , who is that you love .	Tell me in sadness , who is that you love me .
What , shall I groan and tell thee ?	What , I'll sign you and tell me ?
Groan !	Damn it !
Why , no .	Why , no .
But sadly , tell me who .	But that's what I'm told you .
Hold , take these keys , and fetch more spices , Nurse .	Listen to take these measurements , and get more beef , ma'am .
They call for dates and quinces in the pastry .	They call for scaring you and in the goblet .
Come , stir , stir , stir !	Come , Ariel , you're damned , farewell !
The second cock hath crowed .	The second Macbeth has happened .
The curfew bell hath rung .	The friar's ready to start the marketplace .
Spare not for the cost .	Don't take the evidence for the money .
Go , you cot-quean , go .	Go ahead , you need to go .
Get you to bed , faith .	Get to you , Kate .
You'll be sick tomorrow For this night's watching .	You'll be sick tomorrow or this happen .
I have watched ere now All night for lesser cause , and ne'er been sick .	I have gotten down now until they're awake for each other , and I always been sick .
Ay , you have been a mouse-hunt in your time , But I will watch you from such watching now .	Yes , you have a lot to see your time , I will watch you without staining to obey you .
A jealous hood , a jealous hood !	A jealous !
Now , fellow , What is there ?	Now , tell me what is there ?
Make haste , make haste , sirrah .	Make haste , please make us make fun .
I have a head , sir , that will find out logs , And never trouble Peter for the matter .	I have a head , sir , that will find out anything because he'll run away for the matter .

For shame , bring Juliet forth .	For shame , bring out the storm .
Her lord is come .	Her lord is getting up .
She's dead , deceased , she's dead .	She's dead , she's a traitor .
Alack the day !	Damn the day !
Alack the day .	That's the day .
She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !	She's dead , she's dead , she's dead !
Ha ?	Ha ?
Let me see her .	Let me see her .
Out , alas !	Get out , insolent eunuch !
She's cold .	She's calm .
Her blood is settled , and her joints are stiff .	Her blood is carrying out of her and it'll eat .
Life and these lips have long been separated .	People and these days have been long landed .
Death lies on her like an untimely frost Upon the sweetest flower of all the field .	Death lies on her like an sleeping flower on the western flower of all the world .
O lamentable day !	Oh , everyone !
O woeful time .	Oh , it's time .
Death , that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail , Ties up my tongue and will not let me speak .	Death , that has given her permission to make me happy , and I'll beat up my tongue and can't let me speak .
Come , is the bride ready to go to church ?	Come , is the Queen ready to go to church ?
Ready to go , but never to return .	Good-bye to go , but never returns to France .
Death is my son-in-law .	Death is my oldest brother .
Death is my heir .	Death is my heir .
My daughter he hath wedded .	My daughter has also been serious .
I will die , And leave him all .	I will die , because I'm free of all .
Life , living , all is Death's .	Whatever , Stephano , all is all .
Have I thought long to see this morning's face , And doth it give me such a sight as this ?	Have I thought to see this long way , but you'll give me such a soul as this as hell ?
Accursed , unhappy , wretched , hateful day !	Hey , lying , poor , ungrateful day !
Most miserable hour that e'er time saw In lasting labor of his pilgrimage .	You're a hardworking person who ever said to prove different of his upbringing .
But one , poor one , one poor and loving child , But one thing to rejoice and solace in , And cruel death hath catched it from my sight !	But one , one , poor one , and excellent loving one , and one thing to share in , and how cruel I've solved it from my sight !
O woe !	Oh , help !
O woeful , woeful , woeful day !	Oh , it's all this horrible day !
Never was seen so black a day as this .	Let's never see so black as a day .
O woeful day , O woeful day !	Oh , Macbeth , oh , oh !
Beguiled , divorced , wronged , spited , slain !	Maud , Bridget , fine , damn , fast !
Most detestable Death , by thee beguiled , By cruel , cruel thee quite overthrown !	You're sharpening me sleep , you can tell you how much women get you !
O love !	Oh , love !
O life !	Oh , life !
Not life , but love in death .	Not life , but love in death .
Despised , distressed , hated , martyred , killed !	Instead , she's a traitor , she's killed , killed !
Uncomfortable time , why camest thou now To murder , murder our solemnity ?	Really , why are you going to do , monster ?
My soul , and not my child !	My soul , and my child !
Dead art thou !	Dead are you !
Peace , ho , for shame !	Quiet , quiet , for shame !
Confusion's cure lives not In these confusions .	Everything !
Heaven and yourself Had part in this fair maid .	Heaven and yourself have used in this beautiful womb .
Now heaven hath all ,	Now heaven has all ,
And all the better is it for the maid .	And all the better for it is the bigger .
Your part in her you could not keep from death , But heaven keeps his part in eternal life .	Your face is her in her life , even if heaven keeps his affection in heaven , only his life has been alive .
The most you sought was her promotion , For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced .	The empire is her gentlewoman , it's rising to hide what she says your father's mother .
And weep ye now , seeing she is advanced Above the clouds , as high as heaven itself ?	And weep now , why has she turned the wounds on the earth , as high as hell itself ?
Oh , in this love , you love your child so ill That you run mad , seeing that she is well .	Oh , in this love you love your son so much that you run mad , that she is well , that she is well .
She's not well married that lives married long , But she's best married that dies married young .	She's not bad that married one long ago , she's best that married one dies young .
Our instruments to melancholy bells , Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast .	Our regiments are working to each place that is a pleasant play to a burial feast .
Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change , Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse , And all things change them to the contrary .	Our Egyptian rude actors to remain enormous wounds , and it'll be joined to a battle for all the things , and all things answerable to the king's horse .
Every one prepare To follow this fair corse unto her grave .	Every one I'll expect this morning to treat her like this happened .
The heavens do lour upon you for some ill. Move them no more by crossing their high will .	The heavens do lack you for lying on some little sides , and there's no more about their will .
Faith , we may put up our pipes and be gone .	Wait , we may put up our heads and be gone .
Ay , by my troth , the case may be amended .	Yes , by my lord , the case is definitely be cured .
Not a dump , we .	Not a minute , we have .
Tis no time to play now .	It's no time to play now .
You will not then ?	You can't do it ?
No .	No .
I will then give it you soundly .	I won't then give it you to arrange it .
What will you give us ?	What will you give us ?
No money , on my faith , but the gleek .	No money , on my side , but the legal expert .
I will give you the minstrel .	I will give you the message .
Then I will give you the serving creature .	Then I will give you the restful catch .
Then will I lay the serving creature's dagger on your pate .	Then I'll invite the loan on your chamber until you pulled on your sword .
I will carry no crotchets .	I will carry any further .
Then have at you with my wit .	Then have you at my wit with your wit .
Answer me like men .	Answer me like you .
Marry , sir , because silver hath a sweet sound .	Yes , sir , because you've ruined a single tale .
Prates too. , What say you , James Soundpost ?	Instead !
Faith , I know not what to say .	Wait , I know what to say about .
I will say for you .	I will say for you .
It is "music with her silver sound" because musicians have no gold for sounding .	It is with her own indiscretions have gotten up for gold , no gold .
What a pestilent knave is this same !	What a shameless jerk this is a villain !
Hang him , Jack !	Hang him , Titinius !
If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep , My dreams presage some joyful news at hand .	If I can trust the truth of Venice , my mistress plans at some respect of night before me .
Ah me !	Ah !
How sweet is love itself possessed When but love's shadows are so rich in joy !	How sweet is love itself ! " Then all the other thing so deeply !
News from Verona ! , How now , Balthasar ?	Please join from hell , where are you now , Balthasar ?
Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar ?	Didn't you bring me from the letters to the ambassadors ?
How doth my lady ?	How does my lady say ?
Is my father well ?	Is my father well ?
How fares my Juliet ?	How are my slippers ?
That I ask again , For nothing can be ill if she be well .	That I ask again , or I'll be angry if she were well .
Then she is well , and nothing can be ill .	Then she is well , and nothing can be bad .
Her body sleeps in Capels ' monument , And her immortal part with angels lives .	Her body sleeps in Italy , and her sweet York , with her joy is quickly .
I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault And presently took post to tell it you .	I saw her poems in her hair again and took me up to tell you it .
O , pardon me for bringing these ill news , Since you did leave it for my office , sir .	Oh , pardon me for taking news for you , my master , for you did leave it , my lord .
A sick man in sadness makes his will , A word ill urged to one that is so ill .	A sick man who gave birth to a single word , will be much to one that I'm so much .
In sadness , cousin , I do love a woman .	In Spain , cousin , I do love a woman .
A right good markman !	A right good luck !
And she's fair I love .	And she's beautiful , I love you .
A right fair mark , fair coz , is soonest hit .	A right thing with fair deceiving me , goodbye .
Well , in that hit you miss .	Well , in that hit you .
She hath , and in that sparing makes huge waste , For beauty , starved with her severity , Cuts beauty off from all posterity .	She has , and in that makes fun , right : with her beauty , have gotten her fan , it costs all from off .
She is too fair , too wise , wisely too fair , To merit bliss by making me despair .	She is too heavy , wise , too much , except why I could not choose anything like that .
Be ruled by me .	Be quiet by me .
Forget to think of her .	She'll think about her .
O , teach me how I should forget to think !	Oh , that's how I beg you to think about that !
Is it e'en so ?	Is it feasible ?
Then I defy you , stars !	Then I won't mention you , then !
Thou know'st my lodging .	I've heard my lot .
Get me ink and paper , And hire post horses .	Get me balanced and paper , and you'll hire attention .
I will hence tonight .	I will go tonight .
I do beseech you , sir , have patience .	I want to go , sir , you need .
Your looks are pale and wild , and do import Some misadventure .	Your looks are pale and nasty , and don't want to burn him .
Tush , thou art deceived .	Wait , I'm going to Fife .
Leave me and do the thing I bid thee do .	Leave me and do the same thing I can .
Hast thou no letters to me from the friar ?	Has he come to hear me from the bridge ?
No , my good lord .	No , my good lord .
No matter .	No matter .
Get thee gone , And hire those horses .	Get going to get out and cavalry .
I'll be with thee straight .	I'll be with you straight .
Well , Juliet , I will lie with thee tonight .	Well , sir , I will lie with you tonight .
Let's see for means .	Let's see for all .
O mischief , thou art swift To enter in the thoughts of desperate men !	Oh , everyone , it's going to go in the best of these men !
As I remember , this should be the house .	As I remember , this should be the house .
Being holiday , the beggar's shop is shut .	Being standing , the king's one is killed .
What , ho !	Hey , you !
Apothecary !	Damn it !
Who calls so loud ?	Who calls so coldly ?
Come hither , man .	Come here , man .
I see that thou art poor .	I see that you're poor .
Hold , there is forty ducats .	Listen to him there is ten thousand ducats .
Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness , And fear'st to die ?	You're not so high and it's not because of getting to die , and I'm going to die ?
Famine is in thy cheeks .	You're in your own mood .
Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes .	Meanwhile and Ceres declared your ears in love .
The world is not thy friend nor the world's law .	The world is just the same one of the entire world .
The world affords no law to make thee rich .	The world lived is that to make you rich .
Buy food , and get thyself in flesh. , Come , cordial and not poison , go with me To Juliet's grave , for there must I use thee .	Otherwise , hurry .
Holy Franciscan Friar !	That's why she's cheated !
Brother , ho !	Brother , hey !
This same should be the voice of Friar John .	This same should be the voice of Don John .
Welcome from Mantua .	Welcome from crying .
What says Romeo ?	What does that mean ?
Or , if his mind be writ , give me his letter .	Or , if his mind is back , give me his letter .
So that my speed to Mantua there was stayed .	So that my job to anyone one was murdered .
Who bare my letter , then , to Romeo ?	Who takes my face here , then , to wash ?
Unhappy fortune !	Nonsense !
Brother , I'll go and bring it thee .	Brother , I'll go and bring it you .
Now must I to the monument alone .	Now I'd rather listen to the senate room .
Within this three hours will fair Juliet wake .	Isn't this three times this will wake up .
But I will write again to Mantua , And keep her at my cell till Romeo come .	But I won't agree to bed again , and keep her at my tent until you're bothering me .
Poor living corse , closed in a dead man's tomb !	Poor short , support you in a dead man's head !
Give me thy torch , boy .	Give me your iron servant , sir .
Hence , and stand aloof .	You're a traveler , and hurry .
Yet put it out , for I would not be seen .	Whatever seems out of it , I would not be scared .
Give me those flowers .	Give me those hundred .
Do as I bid thee , go .	Do as I get to you , sir .
Yet I will adventure .	Whatever I will .
The boy gives warning something doth approach .	The boy gives everything something gives it .
What cursed foot wanders this way tonight To cross my obsequies and true love's rite ?	What wicked magician protects me from this way to kiss your brow and grow a long ?
What with a torch !	What a farce !
Muffle me , night , awhile .	Wait , you are , Roderigo .
Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron .	Give me that exact evidence and the city's due .
I will be gone , sir , and not trouble you .	I won't be married , sir , and don't trouble yourself .
So shalt thou show me friendship .	So please show me to steal this good .
Take thou that .	Take that you .
Good gentle youth , tempt not a desperate man .	Good princess , please don't have a few onto me .
Fly hence and leave me .	Get up and leave me .
Think upon these gone .	Think about we're right away .
Let them affright thee .	Let them come immediately .
I beseech thee , youth , Put not another sin upon my head By urging me to fury .	I beg you , ma'am , and pour down my horse like that tries to try to get off a fury .
O , be gone !	Oh , be quiet !
Stay not , be gone .	Stay not , I'm gone .
Live , and hereafter say A madman's mercy bid thee run away .	Live , and say goodbye to buy Othello's mercy and tell you all right away .
I do defy thy commination And apprehend thee for a felon here .	I want to finish a few pounds for you can get a fool .
Wilt thou provoke me ?	Didn't I pay you ?
Then have at thee , boy !	Then have at you , boy !
O Lord , they fight !	Oh , Lord of them !
I will go call the watch .	I will go call the watch .
Open the tomb .	Open the tomb .
Mercutio's kinsman , noble County Paris .	He's true , noble Captain Blunt .
What said my man , when my betossed soul Did not attend him as we rode ?	What did you think , my lord , when I could not go around as we have ?
I think He told me Paris should have married Juliet .	I think I told me he'd have said anything too .
Said he not so ?	Aren't he dead ?
Or did I dream it so ?	Or did I dream it so ?
I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave .	I'll recognize you in a kind mood .
A grave ?	A nice ?
Oh , no .	Oh , no .
A lantern , slaughtered youth , For here lies Juliet , and her beauty makes This vault a feasting presence full of light .	A backbiting lord , instead of Cyprus , and here lies like her own beauty , a thousand ducats apiece for miniature portraits of fire .
Death , that hath sucked the honey of thy breath , Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty .	Death , who chooses me have to make the story of your daughters , which had no power on your beauty .
Thou art not conquered .	I'm not quite sane .
O , what more favor can I do to thee , Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain To sunder his that was thine enemy ?	Oh , what I'm saying what I can do to do you to make me like that , since I'm not in its mood to attack that was his enemy ?
Shall I believe That unsubstantial death is amorous , And that the lean abhorred monster keeps Thee here in dark to be his paramour ?	Should I believe that it's death is spinning" , and the very special monster keeps here in hell to be dark in his own ?
Here , here will I remain With worms that are thy chamber maids .	Here , here I will remain as politely that you've got the poor duke's sons .
Oh , here Will I set up my everlasting rest , And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars From this world-wearied flesh .	Oh , here I will set up my rest , and let's shake the teeth of heaven and throw this terrible evidence of this blood .
Eyes , look your last .	Hurry , stop your last .
Arms , take your last embrace .	Meanwhile , take your last room .
Thy drugs are quick .	Your name's invisible and fighting .
Thus with a kiss I die .	I'm like a kiss to die .
These happy masks that kiss fair ladies ' brows , Being black , puts us in mind they hide the fair .	These !
Saint Francis be my speed !	You're a traitor. !
How oft tonight Have my old feet stumbled at graves ! , Who's there ?	How does Lysander work with my old master !
Here's one , a friend , and one that knows you well .	Here's one , a friend , and one that knows you well .
Bliss be upon you !	Sadness is scared !
Tell me , good my friend , What torch is yond that vainly lends his light To grubs and eyeless skulls ?	Tell me , good friend , is my good character , that it's terrible to his cheeks and top fatal ?
As I discern , It burneth in the Capels ' monument .	As I vowed , I'm not interested in the mud by her bedroom .
Who is it ?	Who is it ?
Romeo .	Good-bye .
How long hath he been there ?	How long has he been there ?
Full half an hour .	You're half an hour .
Go with me to the vault .	Go with me to the duel .
I dare not , sir .	I always pray you , sir .
Stay , then .	Stay , then .
I'll go alone .	I'll go alone .
Fear comes upon me .	That's right on me .
Oh , much I fear some ill unthrifty thing .	Oh , much I need some nice thing that .
As I did sleep under this yew tree here , I dreamt my master and another fought , And that my master slew him .	As I did sleep under this storm here , I found my master and master , and that my master wears him delivered my beard .
Romeo ! , Alack , alack , what blood is this , which stains The stony entrance of the sepulcher ?	Hurry !
O comfortable Friar !	Oh , lying !
Where is my lord ?	Where is my lord ?
I do remember well where I should be , And there I am .	I don't remember anything well , because I should be there .
Where is my Romeo ?	Where is my nation ?
I hear some noise .	I hear some noise .
Lady , come from that nest Of death , contagion , and unnatural sleep .	Lady , come from that amount of death , and everything are just a minor .
A greater power than we can contradict Hath thwarted our intents .	A greater power than we can get ashore at our meal .
Come , come away .	Come on , come away .
Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead , And Paris too .	Your husband in your arms lies now , and that's too bad .
Come , I'll dispose of thee Among a sisterhood of holy nuns .	Come on , I'll spy of a mug of memory of a Turkish fleet .
A cup , closed in my true love's hand ?	A grandmother , said in my true hand ?
Poison , I see , hath been his timeless end. , O churl , drunk all , and left no friendly drop To help me after ?	Haven't , I see , has been his own capacities , even if you say , all right , and no little walk after me to help me ?
I will kiss thy lips .	I will kiss your lips .
Haply some poison yet doth hang on them , To make me die with a restorative .	We've been poison some things happened to them , and make them die with a welcoming expression .
Yea , noise ?	Me , really ?
Then I'll be brief .	Then I'll be brief .
O happy dagger , This is thy sheath .	Oh , happy , it's your dagger .
There rust and let me die .	There chooses me and let me die .
This is the place .	This is the place .
There , where the torch doth burn .	There , where the devil's army are waiting .
The ground is bloody. , Search about the churchyard .	The ground is sailing , that's the lot of something .
Pitiful sight !	Hey !
Here lies the county slain , And Juliet bleeding , warm and newly dead , Who here hath lain these two days buried. , Go , tell the Prince .	Here lies the messenger ranger , and that's early , and then , whoever is two and dreadful children , who are two nights here , tell the Prince .
Run to the Capulets .	Run to the ambassadors .
Raise up the Montagues .	Pick up the corpses .
Some others search .	Some others have arrived .
Here's Romeo's man .	Here's another man .
We found him in the churchyard .	We found him in the goblet .
Hold him in safety till the Prince come hither .	Listen to him until the Prince falls here .
Here is a friar that trembles , sighs and weeps .	Here is a lot of sighs and rain , and prepare to capture .
We took this mattock and this spade from him As he was coming from this churchyard's side .	We took this entire house and this just come from him he was from sleeping next side .
A great suspicion .	A great message .
Stay the friar too .	Stay the job too .
What misadventure is so early up That calls our person from our morning rest ?	What is logical , so bright and strong person calling our new army from rest ?
What should it be that is so shrieked abroad ?	What should it be that is so angry ?
Oh , the people in the street cry "Romeo , " Some "Juliet , " and some "Paris , " and all run With open outcry toward our monument .	Oh , the people who said the music falls out , " "The sixth and lastly , how all right , or run away from our open court .
Search , seek , and know how this foul murder comes .	Wait , get ready and know how this horrible murder is .
O heavens !	Oh , help !
O wife , look how our daughter bleeds !	Oh , wife , how are you heir to hell !
This dagger hath mista'en , for , lo , his house Is empty on the back of Montague , And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom .	This dagger has been forbidden to take his own house , then , the penalty of his wallet to be placed in my occult books .
O me !	Oh , me !
This sight of death is as a bell , That warns my old age to a sepulcher .	This sight of death is as a bell , who stabbed my old age to a kingdom .
Alas , my liege , my wife is dead tonight .	Alas , my lord , my sister is dead tonight .
Grief of my son's exile hath stopped her breath .	I'm sure my own family has eaten her long .
What further woe conspires against mine age ?	What else does loose like that great animals ?
Look , and thou shalt see .	Look , and I'm going to let us .
Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while , Till we can clear these ambiguities And know their spring , their head , their true descent , And then will I be general of your woes , And lead you even to death .	Please stand up .
Meantime forbear , And let mischance be slave to patience. , Bring forth the parties of suspicion .	Anyway , Nerissa , until I'm starting to rest to eat the waves of the wedding .
I am the greatest , able to do least , Yet most suspected , as the time and place Doth make against me , of this direful murder .	I am the greatest king , just to think about what you feel , and as the time has made place of me , with this crude mutt .
And here I stand , both to impeach and purge , Myself condemned and myself excused .	And here I stand to both , and he's ready to find you and swear I myself .
Then say at once what thou dost know in this .	Then say at once what you're thinking about this in the forest .
I will be brief , for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale .	I will be brief , for my short , so I'll write out of here as much as a virgin .
Meantime I writ to Romeo , That he should hither come as this dire night , To help to take her from her borrowed grave , Being the time the potion's force should cease .	Anyway , I swear to you , who should come there to be this very happy , I'd help to take her from her own page , where the force brings the money to enjoy .
What can he say in this ?	What can he say in this ?
Their course of love , the tidings of her death .	Their forces of love , the enemy of her death .
Montague !	Damn it !
O brother Montague , give me thy hand .	Oh , brother , give me your hand .
But now , my lord , what say you to my suit ?	But now , my lord , what do you say to my suit ?
But saying o'er what I have said before .	But jealous makes me what I wish before .
My child is yet a stranger in the world .	My child is finally a stranger in the world .
She hath not seen the change of fourteen years .	She has only seen the change of the deep years .
Younger than she are happy mothers made .	Actually , I'll die how foolish life has .
And too soon marred are those so early made .	And too soon I've got one of those things .
But woo her , gentle Paris , get her heart .	But woo her , gentle brother , get her heart .
This night I hold an old accustomed feast , Whereto I have invited many a guest Such as I love .	This night I kept an old feast , since I have met a hundred human as much as I love .
From forth the fatal loins of these two foes A pair of star-crossed lovers take their life , Whose misadventured piteous overthrows Doth with their death bury their parents ' strife .	From out of the magic guards .
The fearful passage of their death-marked love And the continuance of their parents ' rage , Which , but their children's end , naught could remove , Is now the two hours ' traffic of our stage , The which , if you with patient ears attend , What here shall miss , our toil shall strive to mend .	The table !
Such comfort as do lusty young men feel When well-appareled April on the heel Of limping winter treads .	Women .
Even such delight Among fresh fennel buds shall you this night Inherit at my house .	Even like friendship we'll outlast arrive like this night to you than my house at home .
Go , sirrah , trudge about Through fair Verona .	Go , coward , let's see about this simple mood .
Find them out whose names are written here ?	Find them out of your mouth here ?
It is written , that the shoemaker should meddle with his yard and the tailor with his last , the fisher with his pencil and the painter with his nets .	It is written that the miracle should be with his staff and the possessions , his head with the noblest and fighting with his crude population .
But I am sent to find those persons whose names are here writ , and can never find what names the writing person hath here writ .	But I am sent to find those bastards out here , and we'll have sworn in the least what happens tonight has the immediate throne who caused .
Take thou some new infection to thy eye , And the rank poison of the old will die .	Take some new assignments , and your rank members the main of rain will be so pleasant .
Your plantain leaf is excellent for that .	Your logic is getting worse for that .
For what , I pray thee ?	For what , I don't like anything ?
Why Romeo , art thou mad ?	Why , what's going on , mister ?
Not mad , but bound more than a madman is , Shut up in prison , kept without my food , Whipped and tormented and , Good e'en , good fellow .	Not crazy , but foresee for a little pounds than a week , set up in prison , or I'll get my food , and , good knight , good evening .
God 'i ' good e'en .	God bless you , good evening .
I pray , sir , can you read ?	I don't know , sir , can you get it ?
Ay , mine own fortune in my misery .	Yes , my dearest lady has in my cool .
Perhaps you have learned it without book .	Perhaps you have ruined it without complaining .
But I pray , can you read anything you see ?	But I pray , can you read you anything about you ?
Ay , if I know the letters and the language .	Yes , if I know the letters and the language .
Ye say honestly .	What did happen .
Stay , fellow .	Stay , ma'am .
I can read .	I can read that .
Seigneur Martino and his wife and daughters ; County Anselme and his beauteous sisters ; The lady widow of Vitruvio ; Seigneur Placentio and his lovely nieces ; Mercutio and his brother Valentine ; Mine uncle Capulet , his wife and daughters ; My fair niece Rosaline and Livia ;	Sometimes
Seigneur Valentio and his cousin Tybalt ; Lucio and the lively Helena." A fair assembly .	Hamlet." Dutifully and commanding , but he's a traitor and the legal expert beautiful .
Whither should they come ?	Aren't they going to come ?
Up .	Up .
Whither ?	Who's calling me ?
To supper ?	To supper ?
To our house .	To our house .
Whose house ?	Whose house ?
My master's .	My master's decision .
Indeed , I should have asked thee that before .	Indeed , I should have given you that before .
Now I'll tell you without asking .	Now I'll tell you without asking .
My master is the great rich Capulet , and if you be not of the house of Montagues , I pray come and crush a cup of wine .	My master is the great kind and honorable heart , if you weren't the penalty of a lot of sleep , I don't want to get a cup of wine .
Rest you merry !	Everything you mean !
At this same ancient feast of Capulet's Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so loves With all the admired beauties of Verona .	At this same vision of endless discussion .
Go thither , and with unattainted eye Compare her face with some that I shall show , And I will make thee think thy swan a crow .	Go ahead , and with what he wishes that with some face I will make that I will make you , and I can get your letter a minute .
One fairer than my love ?	You're talking about my own sister ?
The all-seeing sun Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun .	The sun means that made her drop first water through the world .
I'll go along , no such sight to be shown , But to rejoice in splendor of mine own .	I'll go along with this man's own mind , even to try to rejoice in this man's own poisoned .
Nurse , where's my daughter ?	Hello , where's my daughter ?
Call her forth to me .	Call her back to me .
Now , by my maidenhead at twelve year old I bade her come .	Now , by my opinion , at twelve months I do like her .
What , lamb !	What , lying !
How now , who calls ?	How did that , sweetheart ?
Your mother .	Your mother .
Madam , I am here .	Madam , I am here .
What is your will ?	What is your will ?
Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age .	I've heard my pretty condition to a very bad .
Faith , I can tell her age unto an hour .	Wait , I can tell her story at an hour .
She's not fourteen .	She's not feeling well .
I'll lay fourteen of my teeth , and yet , to my teen be it spoken , I have but four , she is not fourteen .	I'll lay up to my teeth , and don't let my advice be it up to me , but I've got it , she is not .
Even or odd , of all days in the year , Come Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .	Even or Syracusian , all over here in the year , come at night whenever you like she can be buried .
Susan and she , God rest all Christian souls ! , Were of an age .	Lunatics , and God , God rest her life ! , It's only a big deal .
Well , Susan is with God .	Well , it's with you .
She was too good for me .	She was too good for me .
But , as I said , On Lammas Eve at night shall she be fourteen .	But , as I said , there's been depressed at night to meet you both .
That shall she .	That I'll decide it .
Marry , I remember it well .	Yes , I remember it well .
Tis since the earthquake now eleven years , And she was weaned , I never shall forget it , Of all the days of the year , upon that day .	It's obvious .
For I had then laid wormwood to my dug , Sitting in the sun under the dovehouse wall .	If I had to meet my eyes , in the duke's arrow of the sun lies through the battlefield .
My lord and you were then at Mantua. , Nay , I do bear a brain. , But , as I said , When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple Of my dug and felt it bitter , pretty fool , To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug !	My lord and you were at it .
Shake ! " quoth the dovehouse .	Stop , " it's the devil's one .
Twas no need , I trow , To bid me trudge .	Only no need to worry , I won't let me guide you .
Yea , " quoth he , "Dost thou fall upon thy face ?	Okay , " did he be ashamed to see your face ?
And , pretty fool , it stinted and said "ay." Enough of this .	And , pretty Casca , it is paid and said about this serious qualities .
I pray thee , hold thy peace .	I don't want to make you happy .
Yes , madam .	Yes , madam .
Yet I can not choose but laugh To think it should leave crying and say "ay." And yet , I warrant , it had upon its brow A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone , A perilous knock , and it cried bitterly .	Whatever I can choose .
Yea , " quoth my husband , "Fall'st upon thy face ?	Okay , " did you know your letter , wake your face ?
Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age .	I'm afraid to fall when you were preparing to beauty .
Wilt thou not , Jule ? " It stinted and said "ay." And stint thou too , I pray thee , Nurse , say I .	Please , listen to me , because I said you're looking on me , then I think you wanted to say , I say .
God mark thee to his grace !	God bless you to his grace !
Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed .	He's the smartest partition that ever conjured the world .
An I might live to see thee married once , I have my wish .	As I could see anything to laugh out my daughters , I wish you had .
Tell me , daughter Juliet , How stands your disposition to be married ?	Tell me , daughter , how ungrateful you seem to be married ?
It is an honor that I dream not of .	It is an honor that I just heard of .
Well , think of marriage now .	Well , think about marriage now .
Younger than you Here in Verona , ladies of esteem Are made already mothers .	Meanwhile , since you are loyal , gentlemen of kindness , or I'll wear you .
By my count , I was your mother much upon these years That you are now a maid .	By my notebook , I was your mother on many years except you who are now a real sight .
Thus then in brief : The valiant Paris seeks you for his love .	I'm afraid about here in the marketplace : he's giving you his love for a shame .
A man , young lady !	A man , young lady !
Verona's summer hath not such a flower .	Everything too crass to hold a single match .
What say you ?	What do you say ?
I'll look to like if looking liking move .	I'll look like to send someone like animals .
But no more deep will I endart mine eye Than your consent gives strength to make it fly .	But no more spooky discussion I will keep your consent until your little encounter makes it to make peace .
I must hence to wait .	I must go to school .
I beseech you , follow straight .	I beg you , follow him .
We follow thee. , Juliet , the county stays .	We follow me , ma'am , the war's over .
Go , girl , seek happy nights to happy days .	Go , hurry , let's get happy to sleep on .
What , shall this speech be spoke for our excuse ?	What , you'll have this money for our excuse ?
Or shall we on without apology ?	Or else we won't get such stuff ?
The date is out of such prolixity .	The quality is out of such horrible mission .
But let them measure us by what they will .	But let them go separate ways , or they will .
Give me a torch .	Give me a tip .
I am not for this ambling .	I am not for this for you .
Nay , gentle Romeo , we must have you dance .	Yes , yes , let's go back to you .
Not I , believe me .	Not I said , believe me .
You have dancing shoes With nimble soles .	You have dared , only slaves or exaggerate them .
I have a soul of lead So stakes me to the ground I can not move .	I have a soul of lead contains me to the ground that I can shed for them .
You are a lover .	You are a lover .
Borrow Cupid's wings And soar with them above a common bound .	Meanwhile , she's ready to hear a little dance with your common advice .
I am too sore enpierced with his shaft To soar with his light feathers , and so bound , I can not bound a pitch above dull woe .	I am too expensive with his own idiot with his own light suits you , and so far can not let a guide strike a burning instant easy .
Under love's heavy burden do I sink .	That's dark if we're going to do .
I mean , an we be in choler , we'll draw .	I mean , an an angel in its orbit , will not be embarrassed .
I strike quickly , being moved .	I ate far , being like a dream .
But thou art not quickly moved to strike .	But you're not planning to meet you so soon .
To move is to stir , and to be valiant is to stand .	I'd rather die to be tricked , and to be valiant to be fine .
A dog of that house shall move me to stand .	A dog of that house won't help me to stand .
And to sink in it , should you burthen love , Too great oppression for a tender thing .	And to live in it , you should love , either such a bad thing for a country .
Is love a tender thing ?	Is her a kind thing ?
It is too rough , Too rude , too boisterous , and it pricks like thorn .	It is too hot , too rude , and too , it seems like to think .
If love be rough with you , be rough with love .	If love is covered with you , it's not friendly with love .
Let wantons light of heart Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels .	Let tornadoes of mind make the storm held their lessons with their heads .
Come , we burn daylight , ho !	Come on , we burn men , then !
Nay , that's not so .	Yes , that's just so .
We waste our lights in vain , like lights by day .	We waste our armies in honey , like birds do before the fire .
And we mean well in going to this mask , But 'tis no wit to go .	And we mean well in front of this loan , even if it's no need to go .
Why , may one ask ?	Why , wouldn't one ask ?
I dreamt a dream tonight .	I recognize a dream tonight .
And so did I .	And so did I .
Well , what was yours ?	Well , what was yours ?
That dreamers often lie .	That doesn't lie anything .
In bed asleep while they do dream things true .	In bed while they do only do anything true .
Oh , then , I see Queen Mab hath been with you .	Oh , then , I see you're drowned and I've been tricked with you .
Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose , And then dreams he of smelling out a suit .	Sometimes she landed on a bit like a woman's brother , and then he takes a lot of me .
And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail Tickling a parson's nose as he lies asleep , Then he dreams of another benefice .	And maybe she comes with a snake weapons put a beast as he sat down , he couldn't ruin another body of a Barbary horses .
This is she , Peace , peace , Mercutio , peace !	This is she , Quiet , oh , peace , peace !
This wind you talk of , blows us from ourselves .	This wind you talk about , blows us from ourselves .
Supper is done , and we shall come too late .	Everything is done , and we won't come too late .
On , lusty gentlemen .	On a point , sir .
Strike , drum .	Find up , ma'am .
Where's Potpan , that he helps not to take away ?	Where's that , he wouldn't want to take away ?
When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's hands , and they unwashed too , 'tis a foul thing .	When good manners shall lie all one or two friends , while they get too nice to a big thing .
Away with the joint-stools , remove the court-cupboard , look to the plate .	Go with the shrill spot , just come to the point .
Good thou , save me a piece of marchpane , and , as thou loves me , let the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell. , Antony and Potpan !	Good , you can get a piece of furniture and make me , even if you know the devil's plan to let me find , Antony and Antony !
Ay , boy , ready .	Yes , boy , I'm ready .
You are looked for and called for , asked for and sought for , in the great chamber .	You are looking for and called for you , and asked for you to pay in the great entrails .
We can not be here and there too .	We can not be here and there too .
Cheerly , boys .	Goodbye , boys .
Be brisk 0awhile , and the longer liver take all .	I'm helping the job , and I won't keep it .
Welcome , gentlemen !	Welcome , gentlemen !
She that makes dainty , She , I'll swear , hath corns .	She who makes me , ma'am , I'll swear to have it .
Am I come near ye now ? , Welcome , gentlemen !	Don't I come near your servant , sir , get up ?
By'r Lady , thirty years .	Actually , she's wicked and Miranda .
Tis more , 'tis more .	It's more , it's more .
His son is elder , sir .	His son is Lucentio , sir .
His son is thirty .	His son is approaching .
Will you tell me that ?	Will you tell me that ?
His son was but a ward two years ago .	His son was as a young woman since yourself are .
I know not , sir .	I don't know , sir .
Oh , she doth teach the torches to burn bright !	Oh , she doesn't have the freedom to get ashore !
For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night .	When I was after Regan , both of this night .
This , by his voice , should be a Montague. , What , dares the slave Come hither , covered with an antic face , To fleer and scorn at our solemnity ?	This , that's what happened to his son , he'll be a villain , Help , stay here with the foreign idiot , turn to capture and stick at our own presence ?
Wherefore storm you so ?	What's going on here ?
Uncle , this is a Montague , our foe , A villain that is hither come in spite To scorn at our solemnity this night .	Uncle , this is a tragedy , our fingers had a lot of mind to come in hell before our royal highness ' night .
Young Romeo is it ?	Young disease is it ?
Tis he , that villain Romeo .	It's almost one , that villain .
Content thee , gentle coz .	Goodbye , please , my gentle lord .
Let him alone .	Let him alone .
He bears him like a portly gentleman , And , to say truth , Verona brags of him To be a virtuous and well-governed youth .	He smiled to say like a gentleman who , and to say something , you'll win him more than a new and virtuous youth .
I would not for the wealth of all the town Here in my house do him disparagement .	I would not for the wealth of all the town today , my king has rewarded him .
Therefore be patient .	Don't be patient .
Take no note of him .	Take no problem about him .
You'll not endure him !	You'll not believe him !
Why , uncle , 'tis a shame .	Why , uncle , it's a shame .
Go to , go to .	Go to , go to .
You are a saucy boy .	You are a crab-apple here .
Is 't so , indeed ?	Is that why , Horatio ?
This trick may chance to scathe you , I know what .	This trick on earth is to you , I know what you know .
You must contrary me .	You must go drown me .
I'll make you quiet. , What , cheerly , my hearts !	I'll make you treat me like a tyrant. , my liege !
Have not saints lips , and holy palmers too ?	Have not move up , and holy ones too ?
Ay , pilgrim , lips that they must use in prayer .	Yes , yes , that they must use in love .
O , then , dear saint , let lips do what hands do .	Oh , then , dear God , let them do whatever I mean .
They pray ; grant thou , lest faith turn to despair .	They don't deny to escape , because I won't bite you .
Saints do not move , though grant for prayers ' sake .	We're not planning to make orders for money , for God .
Then move not , while my prayer's effect I take .	Then move , while my Rosalind has been responsible for my efforts .
Thus from my lips , by thine , my sin is purged .	I'm telling you , my lips , my grandmother , is arriving .
Then have my lips the sin that they have took .	Then I've opened my lips that the lion's eyes without complaining .
Sin from thy lips ?	Who's from your lips ?
Give me my sin again .	Give me my robe again .
You kiss by th ' book .	You kiss me by the moon .
Madam , your mother craves a word with you .	Madam , your mother wasn't a word with you .
What is her mother ?	What is her mother ?
I nursed her daughter that you talked withal .	I agree that you died of her father .
I tell you , he that can lay hold of her Shall have the chinks .	I tell you that he can get out of her will make the rumors .
Nay , gentlemen , prepare not to be gone .	Yes , gentlemen , don't need to be gone .
We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. , Is it e'en so ?	We have a reasonable way honey , however it is so unfaithful ?
I'll to my rest .	I'll give up my thoughts .
The quarrel is between our masters and us their men .	The king is between our masters and us in their men .
Tis all one .	It's all one .
I will show myself a tyrant .	I will show myself a tyrant .
The heads of the maids ?	The noblemen of the critics ?
Ay , the heads of the maids , or their maidenheads .	Yes , the Constable of the critics or the splendid .
Take it in what sense thou wilt .	Take it in what sense you've said .
They must take it in sense that feel it .	They must take it in that sense it's true .
Me they shall feel while I am able to stand , and 'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh .	Me already , though I wish to keep you to be a little girl , it's been a pretty piece of flesh .
Tis well thou art not fish .	It's not you're getting worse than you .
Draw thy tool !	Draw your gown !
My naked weapon is out .	My sword is getting out .
Come hither , Nurse .	Come here , ma'am .
What is yond gentleman ?	What is the gentleman ?
The son and heir of old Tiberio .	The son of York and old ends .
What's he that now is going out of door ?	What's happening now , here ?
Marry , that , I think , be young Petruchio .	Yes , that I think , I think it's true .
I know not .	I don't know .
Go ask his name. , If he be married .	Go ask his sanity , if he be married .
What's this ?	What's this ?
What's this ?	What's this ?
The strangers all are gone .	The sky are all right .
Now Romeo is beloved and loves again , Alike bewitched by the charm of looks , But to his foe supposed he must complain , And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks .	Now , good-bye !
And she as much in love , her means much less To meet her new beloved anywhere .	And she deserves as much in love , her tongue means to get her new rightful titles .
But passion lends them power , time means , to meet , Tempering extremities with extreme sweet .	But passion starts power ambles time , not to meet , we'll work with him .
Can I go forward when my heart is here ?	Can I go hide when my heart is here ?
He is wise , And , on my life , hath stol'n him home to bed .	He is wise , because of my life , has been murdered him to bed .
He ran this way and leapt this orchard wall .	He ran away this way and discuss this morning .
Call , good Mercutio .	Call on , good doctor .
Nay , I'll conjure too !	Yes , I'll challenge it !
Romeo !	Damn it !
Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh !	You're helping the gentleman of a gossip in it !
Speak but one rhyme , and I am satisfied .	We're just one who fathered and am I satisfied .
Cry but "Ay me ! " Pronounce but "love" and "dove." Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word , One nickname for her purblind son and heir , Young Abraham Cupid , he that shot so true When King Cophetua loved the beggar maid. , He heareth not , he stirreth not , he moveth not .	Maybe !
An if he hear thee , thou wilt anger him .	If he couldn't get him , you can challenge him .
This can not anger him .	This can always make him .
My invocation Is fair and honest .	My eyesight has always been honest .
Blind is his love and best befits the dark .	Fruits and vegetables don't like his love and the dark .
If love be blind , love can not hit the mark .	If love is so bad , don't accept such a mark .
Now will he sit under a medlar tree And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit As maids call medlars when they laugh alone. , O Romeo , that she were !	Now , Kate !
Go , then , for 'tis in vain To seek him here that means not to be found .	Go , then , for it's in revenge to get out of here that only means to be found .
It is the east , and Juliet is the sun .	It is the smartest animal and the sun is the moon .
Her vestal livery is but sick and green , And none but fools do wear it .	Her once-trimmed hedges , but being sick and bad , but we're going to do it .
Cast it off !	Eighty ducats !
It is my lady .	It is my lady .
Oh , it is my love .	Oh , it is my love .
Oh , that she knew she were !	Oh , that she knew she were !
She speaks , yet she says nothing .	She speaks about what she says nothing .
What of that ?	What of that ?
Her eye discourses .	Her eye is stopped .
Tis not to me she speaks .	It's not me to be Benedick .
Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven , Having some business , do entreat her eyes To twinkle in their spheres till they return .	Two of the stars are all the stars in the earth , some business , don't let them say their plans to push us in their stools .
Her eye in heaven Would through the airy region stream so bright That birds would sing and think it were not night .	Her eye !
See how she leans her cheek upon her hand .	See how she rubs her foot like her hand .
Oh , that I were a glove upon that hand That I might touch that cheek !	Oh , that I were a glove on that hand I could touch that they could wear up !
O Romeo , Romeo !	Oh , that's what !
Wherefore art thou Romeo ?	What's going on , mister ?
Tis but thy name that is my enemy .	It's just your name that is my enemy .
Henceforth I never will be Romeo .	Wish I never will be rewarded .
What man art thou that , thus bescreened in night , So stumblest on my counsel ?	What man is that you're going to hold on me , then you wait on my inadequacy ?
By a name I know not how to tell thee who I am .	By a name I know how to tell you who I am .
Art thou not Romeo , and a Montague ?	You're not going to make a mockery of you ?
The orchard walls are high and hard to climb , And the place death , considering who thou art , If any of my kinsmen find thee here .	The Queen will grow up and early , and the place I looks about how to you , I'm sure you're having a friend of my family before you .
Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me .	Don't insult your mother's waiting to me .
If they do see thee they will murder thee .	If they see things you're fighting about you .
Look thou but sweet , And I am proof against their enmity .	Look who's been serious , but I am satisfied against their own .
I would not for the world they saw thee here .	I wouldn't want to take the world where they were here .
My life were better ended by their hate Than death prorogued , wanting of thy love .	My life were better than their accusations should hate me , because of your love is fairly .
Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face , Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek For that which thou hast heard me speak tonight .	I'm sure you can waste away from my face on my face , but a maiden telling you that which was thinking that I'm done about me anymore .
Dost thou love me ?	Didn't you love me ?
I know thou wilt say "ay , " And I will take thy word .	I know what you've said to say , because I will get your word .
What shall I swear by ?	What can I swear by ?
Do not swear at all .	Don't worry at all .
Or , if thou wilt , swear by thy gracious self , Which is the god of my idolatry , And I'll believe thee .	Or , if you can , by your dear self , which is the kind of my kingdom , and I'll never believe you .
If my heart's dear love , Well , do not swear .	If my dear heart's going , love , do not swear .
Although I joy in thee , I have no joy of this contract tonight .	Although I followed you , I have no mercy like this except the duke of England .
This bud of love , by summer's ripening breath , May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet .	This guy will tell by about this kind youth , when it's a strange thing when we meet .
As sweet repose and rest Come to thy heart as that within my breast .	As sweet luck and rest comes to your heart as that shines on my own body .
O , wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied ?	Oh , can you leave me so easily ?
What satisfaction canst thou have tonight ?	What proof can do you have tonight ?
Th ' exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine .	Other countries criticize me , for your sweet Bianca .
I gave thee mine before thou didst request it , And yet I would it were to give again .	I gave you myself to get it , since I didn't never get it to give up again .
Wouldst thou withdraw it ?	Can't God try to cry ?
For what purpose , love ?	For what I'm leaving , then ?
But to be frank , and give it thee again .	But to be patient , and give it to you again .
And yet I wish but for the thing I have .	And yet I wish I should have the thing I need .
My bounty is as boundless as the sea , My love as deep .	My highness is as clear as the sea , not as deep as my wounds .
I hear some noise within .	I hear some noise .
Dear love , adieu. , Anon , good Nurse ! , Sweet Montague , be true .	Dear love , please , good Meg , good Meg , be brave , I'm true .
Stay but a little .	Stay just a little .
I will come again .	I won't come again .
O blessed , blessed night !	Oh , blessed night !
I am afeard , Being in night , all this is but a dream , Too flattering sweet to be substantial .	I am willing , I'm locked in all this time , but it's just a dream to marry sweet .
Three words , dear Romeo , and good night indeed .	Everything's fine , my good friend , and good night .
Fear me not .	That's me .
Let us take the law of our sides .	Let us take the law of our swords .
Let them begin .	Let them go .
I will frown as I pass by , and let them take it as they list .	I will sleep around as fast as I get out of it , as they don't take it .
Nay , as they dare .	Yes , as they planned .
I will bite my thumb at them , which is a disgrace to them , if they bear it .	I bet my goblins at them , which is a disgrace to them , if they don't like it .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?	Do you recognize your dissatisfaction with you , sir ?
I do bite my thumb , sir .	I don't want to recognize my father .
Do you bite your thumb at us , sir ?	Do you recognize your dissatisfaction with you , sir ?
Do you quarrel , sir ?	Do you want to play , sir ?
Quarrel , sir ?	Hello , sir ?
No , sir .	No , sir .
Tomorrow will I send .	Tomorrow will I send .
So thrive my soul , A thousand times good night !	So how's my soul a thousand times good night !
A thousand times the worse to want thy light .	A thousand ducats is the worse to your Egyptian match .
Bondage is hoarse , and may not speak aloud , Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies , And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine , With repetition of "My Romeo ! " It is my soul that calls upon my name .	Really , it's okay .
How silver-sweet sound lovers ' tongues by night , Like softest music to attending ears !	How seems lovers ' faces are married by music , or other to kill myself !
Romeo !	Damn it !
My nyas ?	My darling ?
What o'clock tomorrow Shall I send to thee ?	What tomorrow will I send to you ?
By the hour of nine .	By the hour of nine years .
I will not fail .	I can't trust you .
Tis twenty year till then .	It's twenty times around then .
I have forgot why I did call thee back .	I haven't forgotten anything I did accuse you back .
Let me stand here till thou remember it .	Let me stand here until you remember it .
And I'll still stay , to have thee still forget , Forgetting any other home but this .	And I'll still be here to have to live , you have any choice but this .
Tis almost morning .	It's almost morning .
And yet no further than a wanton's bird , That lets it hop a little from his hand Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves , And with a silken thread plucks it back again , So loving-jealous of his liberty .	And yet .
I would I were thy bird .	I would I were your bird .
Sweet , so would I .	Sweet , so would I .
Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing .	Whatever I should kill you with much conditions .
Good night , good night !	Good night , good night !
Parting is such sweet sorrow That I shall say good night till it be morrow .	Actually , it's true : I won't say good luck till it be morning .
Sleep dwell upon thine eyes , peace in thy breast .	You're crying in your family's tomb , go on your ears .
Would I were sleep and peace , so sweet to rest .	Would I were food and peace , so sweet to rest .
Hence will I to my ghostly friar's close cell , His help to crave and my dear hap to tell .	You're going to let my sins back to you , my help , let's listen to my excuse .
The gray-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night , Checkering the eastern clouds with streaks of light , And fleckled darkness like a drunkard reels From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels .	The wall looks like the cold shore , the smaller dogs of the moon with light , and trees like a parrot protected on through the marketplace and walk around with useless pleas and open them .
Now , ere the sun advance his burning eye , The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry , I must upfill this osier cage of ours With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers .	Now , until the sun beetle makes his horns on the end of day , and we'll try to earn this man's slavery and fife , which I must permit any satisfaction of water and feed .
The earth , that's nature's mother , is her tomb .	The earth , that's how she is her , right her .
And from her womb children of divers kind We sucking on her natural bosom find , Many for many virtues excellent , None but for some and yet all different .	And from her servant who caused her kind women like her own natural daughters , made many of excellent honor for many times , but something for all they have yet .
Oh , mickle is the powerful grace that lies In herbs , plants , stones , and their true qualities .	Oh , it's the king's army that lies , Horatio , and other , loyal , and their true qualities .
For naught so vile that on the earth doth live But to the earth some special good doth give .	For goodbye .
Virtue itself turns vice , being misapplied , And vice sometime by action dignified .	Actually , it's shaped like being mocked , and you're staying by himself .
Within the infant rind of this small flower Poison hath residence and medicine power .	Undress the floor of this small work and cavalry to me and needs try to help .
Two such opposed kings encamp them still , In man as well as herbs , grace and rude will .	Two of perfect cheeks did not go still , as much as you , and senators , love will become .
And where the worser is predominant , Full soon the canker death eats up that plant .	And where the actors is like the roof , the dawn navy flat up that hawthorn pain of the grass .
Good morrow , Father .	Good morning , General .
Benedicite .	Okay .
What early tongue so sweet saluteth me ?	What two years will be sad for me ?
Young son , it argues a distempered head So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed .	Young son , it takes a single curse I found to enjoy your good luck to this .
Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye , And where care lodges , sleep will never lie .	Instead .
But where unbruised youth with unstuffed brain Doth couch his limbs , there golden sleep doth reign .	But where Nature tells us to buy his skills troops , there puts him up and fighting clothes .
Therefore thy earliness doth me assure Thou art uproused by some distemperature .	Don't insult me to sleep until I heard it is some real beard .
Or if not so , then here I hit it right : Our Romeo hath not been in bed tonight .	Or if not so , then I hit it : right away : I've been schooled not in bed tonight .
That last is true .	That last is true .
The sweeter rest was mine .	The storm was killed .
With Rosaline , my ghostly Father ?	With what my answer's is a traitor ?
That's my good son .	That's my good son .
But where hast thou been , then ?	But where are you been , then ?
I'll tell thee ere thou ask it me again .	I'll tell you what you've said it will hurt me again .
Both our remedies Within thy help and holy physic lies .	Both our plan has struck the one and watch it .
I bear no hatred , blessed man , for , lo , My intercession likewise steads my foe .	I don't expect any commerce , but if he won't pay for my wife , my dear Bianca .
